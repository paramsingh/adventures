  "prompt": "You find yourself standing at the foot of the mighty Himalayas, the soft hum of the bustling market in Darjeeling behind you gradually fading into the ethereal silence of the snow-capped mountains ahead. A monk from the local monastery hands you an old, worn parchment. As you unfurl it, you see a map marked with treacherous trails, sacred temples, and what seem to be the locations of four ancient artifacts.\n\nJust as the monk was about to speak, four men, garbed in clothes that speak of wealth, power, and a certain disregard for the sanctity of these lands, charge towards you. They are from The East India Company, their intentions clear: plunder and steal the artifacts. \n\n1. Use your knowledge of martial arts to defend yourself and the map.\n2. Try to negotiate and reason with the men from The East India Company.\n3. Distract them and make a quick escape into the mountains.\n4. Surrender the map to them.",
