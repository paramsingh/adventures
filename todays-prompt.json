  "prompt": "In the year 2290, the terrestrial landscape of India has drastically evolved. The Republic, though still steeped in its rich, ancient history, is now a juggernaut of innovation and technological prowess. Above the bustling megacities, hovercars swoosh past grand skyscrapers that touch the ionosphere, while the once mighty Ganges now flows with bio-luminescent nanobots. The balance between the old world and the new is delicately maintained.\n\nYou are Kavi, a brilliant yet roguish technician living in the heart of Mumbai 3.0, known for its enormous monolithic structures fashioned from metallic alloys, and large domed skygardens. You have a reputation of having the ability to fix, hack, and manipulate any tech that comes your way. \n\nOne night, as Mumbai's advanced neon lights drape the city, an urgent knock echoes on the door of your small yet well-stacked workshop. In the doorway stands an android with a worn and battered exterior, a rare sight in these polished parts of the city.\n\n\"Kavi,\" it communicates through static-laden vocals, \"You are needed. An unidentified object of immense power and unknown origin has landed in the Thar Desert. The balance is at stake.\"\n\n1. Do you investigate the scene immediately, taking the fastest hoverbike you have?\n2. Do you ask the android to explain more about the mysterious object?\n3. Do you ignore the request, showing the android out of your workshop?\n4. Do you agree to go but insist on getting allies and high-tech gadgets from the black market first?",
