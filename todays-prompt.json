  "prompt": "In a world where mystic creatures and ancient wisdom play more than a myth, you find yourself in the bustling streets of Old Delhi, India. A crumpled map in your hands has led you here, to the opening of a forgotten alley, hidden under the overgrown foliage of a 400-year-old neem tree.\n\nYou're not just anyone, but the reincarnation of the legendary explorer Vijay Varma, destined to recover the lost artifact - The Ruby of Rudra, rumored to hold the key to unimaginable power. Centuries ago, it was lost within the treacherous labyrinth of the mythical city of Bhogavati, deep under the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe entrance to this perilous journey is said to be hidden somewhere in Old Delhi. Legends whispered of a guardian who can guide seekers to the lost city, though none have returned to confirm the tale.\n\nYour heart races as the old world charm of the city masks the danger lurking in the shadows. All you have is a cryptic clue - \"Where the minaret kisses the moon, the guardian's song you'll hear soon.\"\n\n1. Would you venture further into the alleyway?\n2. Would you ask the local chaiwala about the cryptic clue?\n3. Would you climb the neem tree to get a better view?\n4. Or, would you venture through the marketplace hoping to find more information?",
