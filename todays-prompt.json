  "prompt": "The sun begins to sink behind the Ghats, casting long shadows across the ancient city. You, a renowned warrior from the Kshatriya caste, stand on the peaks overlooking the vibrant city of Hastinapura in the midst of a lost era. Far below the sound of bustling markets among temples, the smell of smoky incense, and the iridescent shimmer coming from the mighty river Ganges, paint a vividly serene picture. Recently, however, tensions have been rising. Rumours circulate about an ancient demon spirit, Rakshasa, preparing to rise from the depth of the mountain caves to bring about the end of days.\n\nA royal messenger approaches, panting heavily and bearing the royal seal. He hands you a scroll that reads, \"We have been betrayed. Our boundaries have been breached and the devious Pengal wizards from the south are responsible. They seek to control the Rakshasa for their personal gains. As our bravest warrior, your mission is clear. You must foil their plans and restore peace.\"\n\n1. Do you journey to the south, and infiltrate the wizards directly?\n2. Do you seek guidance from the ascetics living high up in the mountains?\n3. Do you gather local warriors and prepare for an open battle?\n4. Or do you plunge into the depths of the mountain cave to confront Rakshasa first?",
