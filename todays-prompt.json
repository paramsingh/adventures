  "prompt": "You wake up groggy in a strange room, the air tainted with an aromatic blend of spices you can't quite put a finger on. You look around. You're in a quaint, modest room, the furniture minimalistic - a cot, a table, a wooden stool. But something doesn't feel right. On the table, you find a letter, addressed to you.\n\nYou don't remember anything past boarding that flight to India, your mind a confusing jumble of incomplete memories. Come to think of it, you don't remember India ever looking like this. As you shake your head in an attempt to stave off the dizziness, a deafening noise rings from the outside.\n\nPeeking through a tiny window, you see a brilliant spectacle of thousands of people, dancing, singing, and painting the town in vibrant hues. Realization dawns - it's the festival of Holi, the Festival of Colours. As your eyes roam across the dynamic riot of colour and movement, your gaze is intercepted by a pair of intense, scrutinizing eyes.\n\nA mysterious figure standing far from the crowd is staring at you, a man in a dark kurta, turban obscuring most of his features save for those piercing eyes. The man raises a hand and gestures, beckoning, before disappearing into the throng.\n\nDo you:\n1. Ignore the mysterious figure, stay inside and read the letter.\n2. Leave the room and join the festival.\n3. Creep out of the room to follow the mysterious man.\n4. Seek a backdoor to escape this baffling situation.",
