  "prompt": "A deafening explosion shakes you from your sleep as your tiny apartment in the heart of New Mumbai trembles. You rush to the window, peering out just in time to see a massive space frigate hurtling towards the densely-populated neighborhood, its radio tower leaving a blazing trail of sparks and smoke as it scrapes against the sky-rises.\n\nAs you start to pack essentials into your backpack, you notice a small blinking box on the floor. You pick it up, and it begins to speak in a calm robotic tone: \"Mission data retrieved. Initiating holographic projection.\" You realize that it's a classified message for you, from an unknown alien resistance group. It turns out that the frigate is a deep-space reconnaissance ship from a sinister alien race called the Syllrax, who have landed in India to scout for a hidden trans-dimensional wormhole.\n\nThe hologram blinks out, and you find yourself faced with a decision. There are four paths you can choose:\n\n1. Investigate the wreckage of the space frigate to learn more about the Syllrax and their intentions.\n2. Determine the location of the wormhole and find a way to seal it, thus preventing the Syllrax invasion.\n3. Rescue civilians in danger and gather them to form a local resistance movement against the aliens.\n4. Head to Bengaluru Space Research Centre to seek knowledge, support, and resources from other resistance groups.",
