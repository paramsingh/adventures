You're in the heart of Mumbai, India, beneath the disarray of brightly colored cloth awnings strung haphazardly above the narrow streets lined with food stalls, spice vendors, and wandering livestock. Behind you looms a colossal, ornate building - the local police headquarters. This is where your life as an undercover agent begins.\n\nYou have been given a straightforward mission: Infiltrate the crime syndicate operating out of the Crooked Cobra, a notorious underground club hidden away in the city's labyrinthine slums. The syndicate is said to be involved in illicit activities of grave consequences, and it's your task to unearth their plans and resources. You must act with caution, for a wrong step would spell disaster.\n\nIn your pocket, an encrypted communication device hums softly. You take a deep breath, fortifying yourself for the task at hand. You know you have to prepare for the undertaking and gather necessary resources before embarking on the mission.\n\n1. You could make your way to a dark electronics market to try and procure some advanced spy equipment for your mission.\n2. You could seek out your old contact, Ravi, known for his intelligence and vast connections in Mumbai's underworld.\n3. You contemplate visiting a local temple first, to seek blessings and perhaps some peace of mind.\n4.
