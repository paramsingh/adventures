  "prompt": "In the mystical lands of ancient India, you find yourself in the lush forest of Kalakkadu. The sun is beginning to set, casting long shadows on the ground as the smell of rain lingers in the air. You are a brave adventurer who has been seeking three powerful artifacts that are said to hold immense power. These artifacts are rumored to be hidden in various temples scattered across the Indian subcontinent.\n\nYour journey has brought you here, to a long-forgotten shrine deep within the heart of the forest. You hope the first of the three artifacts, the Amulet of Arushi, resides within its walls. The shrine appears to be ancient and is wrapped in vines and overgrowth. The entrance is guarded by detailed stone statues, each brandishing a weapon. Your eyes are drawn to one statue in particular, its left hand extended with a scroll in its grip.\n\nAs you step forward to take the scroll, you notice four possible paths that lie ahead, each marked by a symbol carved into a stone tablet. You feel that each path will test you in different ways before you can claim the amulet.\n\nWhich path do you choose?\n\n1. The Path of Strength, marked with the symbol of a mighty fist.\n2. The Path of Wisdom, marked with the symbol of an open book.\n3. The Path of Endurance, marked with the symbol of a blazing sun.\n4. The Path of Agility, marked with the symbol of a swift arrow.",
