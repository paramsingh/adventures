  "prompt": "The full moon casts eerie shadows down the narrow alleyways of Delhi, India, as you emerge from the metro station. You received a letter earlier this week from an anonymous sender, stating that a terrifying creature known as the Rakshasa has been terrorizing the city, and you, as a renowned paranormal investigator, are the city's last hope.\n\nRumours say the Rakshasa dwells by the dilapidated stepwells, only appearing at the stroke of midnight. Your pocket watch shows 11:50 p.m., giving you ten minutes to prepare. The city's historical charm is overlaid with a nightmarish undertone: shuttered shops, flickering street lights and the deafening silence, shattered only by the occasional hushed whisper or distant dog\u2019s bark.\n\nYou clutch the letter tightly in your hand. It's time to begin.\n    \n1. Proceed to the haunted stepwells immediately.\n2. Visit the nearby local temple first to pray for protection.\n3. Head to the market to stock up on supplies.\n4. Consult the city's oldest inhabitant for more information.",
