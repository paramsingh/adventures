He scrambles back up to his feet, clearly terrified, and starts running towards you. His eyes lock with yours, filled with desperation.\n\nYou feel his fear.\n\n\"Please, you must help me! I am being hunted. They want the secret of the artifact I possess, and they will kill me for it!\" With trembling hands, he opens a simple cloth bag, revealing a seemingly ordinary brass bowl hidden within. Upon closer inspection, it is anything but ordinary\u2014the bowl is engraved with ornate patterns and ancient inscriptions.\n\nAn unmarked black SUV screeches to a halt nearby. Four masked men step out, armed with guns, and advance towards you both.\n\nThe runaway man pleads, \"We must escape!\"\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Agree to help the man and figure out a way to escape.\n2. Decline and distance yourself from the man and danger.\n3. Confront the armed men before they reach you.\n4. Seek help from the people around you.",
