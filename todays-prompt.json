An old worn parchment in your hands narrates the legend of an artifact of immeasurable power, The Trishula, said to be hidden deep within the throes of this temple's puzzling labyrinths.\n\nHowever, tension holds the air as rival factions, menacing thieves, and cunning predators too have caught wind of the fabled artifact. The unascribed shadows of these sinister faces watch your every move, ready to pounce and claim the Trishula for themselves. Our adventure commences here, in the wild heartland of Rajasthan.\n\n1. Quickly start exploring the temple before others get to the artifact.\n2. Booby trap the entrance to the temple to hinder others once they try to follow you.\n3. Approach a group of local guides and ask them to take you to the artifact.\n4. Sneak around to see if you can find out how prepared the other factions are.",
