  "prompt": "In the heart of mystical India, in a bygone era where the line between the earthly and the divine is blurred, you find yourself in a bustling marketplace of Jambukeswarar, a lush city nestled near the banks of the sacred Kaveri river. The air is filled with the scent of rich spices and the sounds of lively banter from the crowd. You're a heartful adventurer, an unsuspecting blend of local heritage imbued with unique magical abilities yet unexplored. \n\nSuddenly, a visibly distressed man, his robes shrouded in a supernatural sparkle, rushes and collides into you, dropping a strange artifact. It's a beautifully intricate amulet, glowing with an ethereal light. His eyes connect with yours, full of fear and desperation, before he gets swallowed by the crowd. From afar, a blood-curdling howl resonates, silencing the marketplace momentarily. Something\u2019s not right.\n\n1. Do you pick up the amulet and inspect it?\n2. Do you follow the man?\n3. Do you inquire about the man from the people around you?\n4. Do you ignore the scene and continue with your original plans?",
