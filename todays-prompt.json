  "prompt": "Far beneath the animated thrum of Mumbai nightlife, beneath the swirl of car horns, persistent vendors, and ceaseless vibrations of life, exists an ancestral land drenched in silence. In this place, your forefathers uttered hushed prayers to ancient deities, long before the noise of technology encroached. It is into this eerie solitude that you, Karan, a cashier by day and an aspiring author by night, have traveled in search of a tale that could churn the guts of your most skeptical critics.\n\nArmed only with a pen, a notepad, and a single candle, you stand before the entrance of the fabled Vyomasura Caves, whispered by locals to be cursed. Ominous granite gapes at you, a dark gullet ready to swallow all light. Cold sand crunches beneath your feet, and a fetid scent of decay wafts out. There's a sense of unseen eyes watching you, and the hairs at the back of your neck prick up.\n\n1. Do you light the candle and step into the cave, undeterred by the atmosphere?\n2. Do you call out to anything lurking inside?\n3. Do you attempt a hasty scribble in your notepad about the unsettling aura?\n4. Or do you retreat to gather more local insight about the cave?",
