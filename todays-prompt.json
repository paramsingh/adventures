  "prompt": "Underneath the star-studded night sky, the bustling city of Mumbai, India, falls mute, overpowered by the unnatural hum of a colossal, metallic spaceship as it descends, looming ominously over the Marine Drive. The usual honks and chatters are replaced by astonished gasps and hushed whispers. Your name is Dr. Aryan Kapoor, one of the most brilliant astrophysicists in the nation, and currently the only hope of survival for the entire human race. Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy ship, understand their plot, and stop the apparent invasion.\n\nSquatting in an alley, you peer through your night vision binoculars at the alien behemoth while clutching a handheld teleportation device - the latest government-sanctioned tech. Suddenly, you notice a weak point in the ship's hull - a very intricate gravity loop trap. It\u2019s guarded, but it seems to be the only possible way in. \n\n1. Teleport onto the ship discretely and try to find out more about the aliens' plans.\n2. Make your way to the nearest defense station and report your discovery.\n3. Try to disable the gravity loop trap from the ground politely using your devices.\n4. Ignore the situation and continue with your night, convincing yourself this is just a dream.",
