  "prompt": "With the monsoon season upon the mystical land of India, you find yourself nestled within the bustling streets of the ancient city of Ujjain. From the chatter of merchants haggling over the price of spices to the distant tolling bells of the mighty Mahakaleshwar Temple, the city teems with life. Your name is Ajay, a cunning and resourceful thief, carrying the legacy of a legendary lineage of shadow-walkers, known for their unparalleled secrecy, agility, and cleverness.\n\nHowever, turning corners and slipping through alleyways, you find trouble brewing. The sacred Idol of the Eternal Flame, kept inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Mahakaleshwar Temple, has been stolen. Rumor has it that only the Idol can save Ujjain from the disastrous 'Eternal Night Curse' that befalls the city every 100 years. With two days before the curse, the king of Ujjain has offered a grand reward to the one who returns it.\n\nVentures of such caliber seldom escape from your attention. You hand over a pouch of stolen emeralds to your contact, Ramu, the city's corrupt gatekeeper, ensuring his lips stay sealed about your upcoming adventures. Stealthily advancing towards your next decision, you weigh your options-\n\n1. Infiltrate the king's council to gather information about other potential competitors.\n2. Visit the local thieves' den to get potential leads on the idol.\n3. Interrogate Ramu about any unusual activities in the city.\n4. Head towards the library to research this 'Eternal Night Curse'.",
