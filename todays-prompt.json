Your mission is to activate the \"Predator Protocol\" \u2013 an AI weapon system that Earth had sent spiralling through space a decade ago as a silent guardian against hostile alien races.\n\nAs you emerge from the starship, the arid landscape expands in every direction. Against the sunset, you see the silhouette of an ancient temple - the hidden location of the Predator Protocol. Now your journey begins.\n\n1. Head straight to the temple.\n2. Search the starship for useful supplies.\n3. Scan the area with your tricorder to gain more information about the surroundings.\n4. Try to establish communication with Earth.",
