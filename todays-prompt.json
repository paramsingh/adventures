  "prompt": "You find yourself wandering through a dense and eerie forest in the dead of night. The trees loom overhead, casting long, ominous shadows that seem to reach out towards you. The wind whispers through the branches, carrying with it a sense of unease.\n\nAs you walk deeper into the forest, you come across a small clearing. In the center of the clearing stands an ancient, dilapidated mansion. The windows are boarded up, and the front door hangs crookedly on its hinges. The entire structure radiates a malevolent energy that chills you to the bone.\n\nFeeling a sense of dread but compelled to explore, you cautiously make your way towards the mansion. The door creaks open as you push it, revealing a dimly lit foyer. The air is thick with dust, and the faint scent of decay lingers in the air.\n\nSuddenly, you hear a shuffling sound coming from one of the darkened hallways. Your heart races as you realize you are not alone in this haunted mansion.\n\n1. Investigate the source of the shuffling sound.\n2. Retreat back outside and leave the mansion.\n3. Call out to see if anyone is there.\n4. Arm yourself with any nearby objects for protection.",
