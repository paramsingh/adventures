The city pulsates with charm and enigma, holding secrets penned on ancient parchments within the heart of these pulsating streets. You are Veer, a seasoned private detective, well reputed for resolving some of the most convoluted puzzles the city has ever seen.\n\nTonight, a mysterious letter had appeared beneath your office door, stained by age and carrying a faint, puzzling fragrance of jasmine. Its script held an urgent plea from an anonymous client asking for your help to solve a cryptic mystery. Your task was to locate the \"Heart of Kali,\" a legendary gemstone lost in the bewildering maze of Kolkata.\n\nVeer stood tall, surrounded by a sea of folders, maps, and tattered notes, took a sweeping glance at the dimly lit room, releasing a sigh into the pungent air of dust and cinnamon from his ever present pipe. The time had come to step into the city's underbelly, where curiosity was both a compass and a curse.\n\n1. The letter had no return address; would you want to investigate the origin of the letter?\n2. Do you wish to dive deep into historical records and research about the \"Heart of Kali?\"\n3. Would you start by probing any known artifact dealers or underground black market?\n4. Or, could you connect to old contacts for any whispers about this mysterious gem in the underbelly?",
