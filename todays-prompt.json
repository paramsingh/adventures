  "prompt": "Beneath the vibrant hues of a setting sun, you find yourself standing at the entrance of the glorious stone labyrinth of Ajanta, a series of 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments in Maharashtra, India. Nestled in the rugged hills, the caves are a vision of exquisite art and architecture from ancient India. Your journey here is not that of a mere sightseer but of an adventurer. As Ravi, a young historian and part-time adventure seeker, you've been entrusted with a centuries-old mission - to find the Lost Wisdom, an ancient text believed to be hidden within the mysterious depths of the Ajanta caves.\n\nAhead of you, the cavernous entrance threatens to swallow all light, leaving its secrets hidden in the echoes of forgotten years. You have only your wits, a flickering torch, your trusty satchel, and an old, vague map that has been passed down through the generations in your family.\n\n1. Step cautiously into the darkness of the first cave.\n2. Take a moment to study the map.\n3. Examine your satchel's contents.\n4. Whistle a tune to see if the echo provides any secrets before proceeding into the cave.",
