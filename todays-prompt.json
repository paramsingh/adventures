  "prompt": "You find yourself standing at the entrance of an old, dilapidated mansion in the heart of a remote village in India. The moon hangs low in the sky, casting eerie shadows on the overgrown garden and crumbling walls. As you step inside, the air grows thick with the scent of decay and something more sinister.\n\nThe floors creak beneath your feet as you explore the dimly lit corridors, the only sound being the distant howl of the wind outside. Suddenly, you hear a faint whisper that seems to echo from the walls themselves. Ignoring the chill that runs down your spine, you press on, determined to uncover the secrets of this haunted place.\n\nAs you reach the grand staircase that leads to the upper floors, a figure emerges from the shadows. A woman with long, unkempt hair and tattered clothes stands before you, her pale face twisted in a malicious grin. Before you can react, she vanishes into thin air, leaving you alone in the darkness.\n\n1. Follow the mysterious woman upstairs.\n2. Turn back and leave the mansion.\n3. Search for clues in the room she appeared in.\n4. Call out to the woman and try to communicate with her.",
