  "prompt": "As the sun sets over the bustling streets of Jaipur, India, you, a renowned treasure hunter named Arjun, find yourself standing before the doors of the ancient and mysterious Amber Palace, an immense structure of red sandstone and marble that towers over the city. Your pulse quickens as you clutch the key tightly in your hands, a key you obtained through a harrowing journey across the land. You know that inside lies the fabled Chintamani Jewel, an artifact of unimaginable value and power said to grant the one who possesses it their heart's deepest desires.\n\nThe courtyard is silent, only the echoes of your footsteps break the eerie tranquility. Suddenly, a low cawing resonates through the silence - a murder of crows burst from the banyan trees, their dark figures cutting through the twilight as they disappear into the night sky. \n\nYou feel it, something moving in the shadows. Your instincts kick in. You're not alone.\n\nDo you:\n1. Quickly draw your weapon and stand your ground.\n2. Try to quietly evade your unknown assailant.\n3. Call out to whoever or whatever is watching you.\n4. Hide and observe from a vantage point.",
