An unnatural fog swirls outside, and a bone-chilling wind howls its mournful song. A flickering oil lamp illuminates a faded map of the mansion, hinting at secrets hidden beyond the brittle walls of your room. \n\nThe map reveals four key places: The haunted kitchen, where phantom cooks are rumored to prepare meals for ghostly patrons; the chilling royal chambers, still reverberating with the echoes of long-dead nobles; an ancient well, which people say holds a regretful spirit; and, lastly, the grand ballroom that supposedly comes to life with spectral dancers on moonless nights.\n\nWhere do you decide to investigate first?\n\n1. The haunted kitchen\n2. The royal chambers\n3. The ancient well\n4. The grand ballroom",
