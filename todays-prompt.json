  "prompt": "You find yourself standing in front of an ornate gate at the entrance of an abandoned mansion in the remote countryside of India. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and the only sound you hear is the rustling of leaves in the wind. As you step inside, the grandeur of the mansion's architecture is juxtaposed with the eerie silence that envelopes the place.\n\nThe main hall is dimly lit by flickering candlelight, casting long shadows on the dusty floor. As you explore further, you come across a portrait of a well-dressed man, his eyes seeming to follow your every move. A chill runs down your spine, but you press on, drawn deeper into the mansion's mysteries.\n\nSuddenly, you hear a faint whisper coming from a nearby corridor. Your heart races as you follow the sound, your footsteps echoing in the empty hallways. You round a corner and come face to face with a ghostly figure, its eyes glowing with a malevolent light. Before you can react, it vanishes into thin air, leaving you alone in the dark.\n\nWhat will you do?\n1. Proceed cautiously down the corridor.\n2. Turn back and try to find your way out of the mansion.\n3. Inspect the surrounding rooms for clues.\n4. Call out to the ghostly figure and try to communicate with it.",
