There are colossal bio-dome cities preserving ancient culture amidst the ruin of global pollution. As the artificial intelligence enhances your senses, the holographic screen in front of you flickers with an incoming transmission from HQ in the domed city of New Delhi.\n\n\"We have lost contact with the remote research facility in Ladakh.
