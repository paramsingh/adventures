Beyond the buzz of the metropolis lies a breathtaking view of the cosmos. The sky is aglow with a cascade of colors from the Andromeda galaxy winking from a distance, the Southern Cross shimmering in deep cosmic blues, and a satellite, the Rajaraja-1, floating by quietly, a testament to Indian Space Reconnaissance's formidable presence in deep space exploration.\n\nYou are Commander Srinivas, a brilliant astrophysicist and a decorated space veteran, known for your courage and ability to remain calm under high pressure. From your private observatory in the heart of this metallic jungle, you're following an unexplained celestial anomaly that could pose a serious risk to Earth's defense systems.\n\nSuddenly, a cryptic interstellar signal distorts the tranquillity of your sync-a-thon. Your personal AI, Arya, promptly deciphers it to be a distress call originating from deep within the uncharted Zeta-9 nebula, a treacherous frontier filled with deadly cosmic storms and mysterious space-time anomalies.\n\n1. Should you contact the Indian Space Reconnaissance and report the anomaly?\n2. Would you analyze the distress signal further to get more information?\n3. Should you ignore the signal and continue your observation of the celestial anomaly?\n4. Would you jump to action, powering your trusty spaceship, the Brahmastra, to investigate the signal yourself?",
