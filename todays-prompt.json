  "prompt": "With every step you take, the eerie silence of the corridor grows more intense. The ancient wooden floors creak underfoot, and your flashlight flickers, as if threatening to plunge you into darkness. You have trekked to a haunted mansion in a small village in India, excited at the prospect of uncovering lost treasures, but things have taken a sinister turn. As the deathly atmosphere of the mansion grips you, the floor gives way beneath you, and you find yourself tumbling into darkness.\n\nYou land, surprisingly unharmed, in a dusty old library. The smell of old parchment and decaying books fills your nostrils. A cold breeze sends chills up your spine, forcing you to wrap your arms around yourself for comfort. As the room's macabre wallpaper filled with images of twisted faces and contorted figures on the walls becomes clear under your fading flashlight, you realize that you are not alone in the mansion. A ghostly figure appears in front of you, clad in a rotting shroud, its eyes glowing an unnatural shade of green.\n\n1. Attempt to communicate with the ghostly figure.\n2. Run to hide among the stacks of books.\n3. Charge at the figure, hoping to scare it away.\n4. Freeze in fear, waiting to see what happens next.",
