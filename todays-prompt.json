The Ganges river, once the holy lifeline, now flows with mercury and liquid silicon. Humans and androids coexist, but whispers of the impending conflict have started to surface. Among the metallic high rises, the Victoria Memorial stands strong, unaffected by the erosion of time and tech invasion, it has been transformed into a mind boggling combination of ancient structure and futuristic technology, a common place for the interstellar visitors wanting to know about the Earth's past.\n\nYou are Jeeva, a tech-diver of Indian roots. Your job is to dive into the memories of ancient machines and extract valuable information.

It's Mona, your childhood friend and a tech engineer from ISRO.\n\n\"Jeeva, I just got an encrypted message from one of our undercover agents in the Intergalactic Council. He intercepted a transmission about a weapon of mass destruction intended to start a war between humans and robots. It's going to be triggered in 24 hours, and its activation code is somewhere in Kolkata. We need you to dive into the old machines of Kolkata and retrieve the code. I'm sending you the coordinates.\"\n\nThe message ends and the coordinates flash on your screen. You have a lead. It's do or die.\n\n1. Prepare to head immediately towards the coordinates.\n2. Try to gain more intelligence regarding the situation from other sources.\n3. Wise to check your diving gear and tools before rushing.\n4. Contact another fellow diver for help.",
