  "prompt": "In the heart of bustling Mumbai, India, you find yourself standing in a narrow alley, surrounded by tall, colorful buildings and the deafening sound of honking vehicles. The air is thick with the smell of spices and unseen danger.\n\nYou, a young archeologist named Sai, have come here following an old map you found in your grandfather's attic. The map seems to point towards a hidden entrance at the end of the alley.\n\nAs you ponder your next move, a group of four young, burly men approach you. The leader, a tattooed man with a pencil-thin mustache, smirks menacingly at you.\n\n\"Hey there,\" he says, voice dripping with menace. \"What brings you to our territory?\"\n\n1. Politely explain who you are and why you are here.\n2. Ignore them completely and continue examining the map.\n3. Attempt to slip away from the group and find your way on your own.\n4. Try to befriend them by complimenting them and offering a peace offering.",
