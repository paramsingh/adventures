A city guarded by an enchanted barrier that has protected its people from the malevolent beings who roam the mountains. As the twilight descends upon the land, you find yourself in a wooden tavern located near the entrance of the city, seated at a corner table with a group of diverse adventurers.\n\nYou share a table with a haughty sorceress, a burly dwarven warrior, a nimble elven ranger, and the ever-mysterious blind seer. The sorceress pulls out an ancient scroll that details a foreboding prophecy. The prophecy speaks of a hidden weapon, The Kali-Yuga, a powerful relic capable of eradicating evil. The seer, however, has a vision of the magical barrier falling, putting Nalanda and its people in grave danger.

Propose a plan to reinforce the enchanted barrier around Nalanda.\n3. Ask the sorceress and the seer for more information regarding the prophecy.\n4. Leave the table, wanting no part in this dangerous quest.",
