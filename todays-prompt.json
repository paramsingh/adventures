  "prompt": "In the magical realm of ancient India, the winds whisper secrets of a hidden treasure stashed away in the heart of a fabled city. As a young adventurer from a distant village, you've listened to the tales of the treasure's allure - insisting that it will bring unfathomable wealth, power, and immortality to whoever uncovers it first. With unmatched curiosity burning your soul, you make the daring decision to set off on a perilous quest, embarking on a path laden with mythical creatures, dangerous terrain, and devious traps.\n\nOne day, as you travel along the dusty ribbon of a trail, the sun's merciless glare beats down upon you. Sweat trickles from your brow as the terrain shifts to dense forestry. After hours of trudging through the sweltering heat, you come across a break in the forest where you're met with a heart-stopping sight: the fabled city lies before you, nestled within the majestic Indian mountains.\n\nJust then, a wizened sage appears beside you as if summoned by your arrival. He welcomes you to Rishitavi, the enchanted city of knowledge. The sage speaks of three fabled objects hidden within the city; each enshrined within guarded temples. To claim the treasure, you must obtain these objects.\n\nHe presents four options:\n\n1. Head to the temple of wind where Malakuta, the king of vipers, slumbers.\n2. Pursue the temple of water where Rahu, the cursed serpent, resides lurking in the shadows.\n3. Enter the temple of fire where Jwalamukhi, the wrathful firebird, soars.\n4. Ignore the sage's advice and try to find the treasure on your own.",
