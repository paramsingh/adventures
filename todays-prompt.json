  "prompt": "The sun barely shines through the thick mist over Mumbai, India. Your name is Devesh, a dashing, self-made scientist engulfed in the wonders of quantum physics. Recently, you discovered a bizarre energy signal originating from the heart of the city. Science cannot explain it yet, and your instincts tell you it's of alien origin. Your home laboratory is a labyrinth of interconnecting laser grids, holographic monitors, and a shiny metallic teleporter in the center, blinked with an ethereal energy. \n\nSuddenly, your quantum radio crackles to life, an unfamiliar and eerie voice echoing from it, \"Devesh, find us...\". You feel a chill run down your spine. It could be them - the extraterrestrial entity hidden within the city.\n\n1) Do you trace the alien signal?\n2) Do you try to communicate with the alien via quantum radio?\n3) Do you ignore the message and continue your research?\n4) Do you venture into the city to investigate?",
