  "prompt": "In the heart of bustling Mumbai, a spacecraft glistens with a timeless shine under moonlight, juxtapositioned against the neo-gothic architecture. You're Admiral Ram, ex-aerospace engineer and overall space enthusiast, entrusted with the mission of a lifetime. An alien signal, originating from a distant galaxy, was intercepted by Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. This signal - an interstellar SOS - could potentially mark the first ever human-reskellin contact.\n\nRam, your spacecraft, christened 'Karma', is equipped with a pulsar map, an artillery system, a drive core powered by dark energy and an AI controller named Radha. \n\nYou prepare to launch from the Gateway of India, the response to the SOS being your prime mission. However, an unusual electromagnetic distortion, last recorded a century ago, is forecasted to hit Earth in 48 hours and may cause catastrophic failure of the ship's drive core if it's still within Earth's orbit. \n\n1. Initiate an immediate launch hoping to breach the atmosphere before the disruption hits.\n2. Delay the launch and try to work out a possible shield against the distortion.\n3. Attempt to modify your drive core to make it resistant to the distortion.\n4. Request for more information and analysis of the prediction to make an informed decision.",
