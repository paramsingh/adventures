  "prompt": "In the year 2255, ex-aristocrat, Professor Aryabhatta Bhat, lives secluded in his old, gothic mansion in Faridabad, India. His days and nights are dedicated to a single cause: opening the door to the cosmos, to unravel the secrets of the universe using an invention of his - the \"Cosmoscope\". \n\nOne crisp morning, an unscheduled, almost cryptic transmission infiltrates the professor's system. The communication originates from an unspecified location within the Orion Nebula. As the interference clears, a distorted figure appears, almost non-human in appearance, begging for help in a language that feels familiar yet foreign.\n\nThe Professor springs to action, triggering a series of levers on a nearby wall. Immediately, the mansion fragments into a colossal spacecraft, and with you as the assistant onboard...our adventure begins. \n\n1. Translate the alien message.\n2. Track the source of the transmission.\n3. Create a response message.\n4. Organize your tools for action.",
