  "prompt": "Year 2175. The city of New-Delhi has transformed into a sprawling, neon-lit metropolis, an amalgamation of ancient history and cutting-edge technology. Gigantic hover-towers scrape the sky, piercing through the polluted smog. The roads, once jam-packed with auto-rickshaws and cars, are now buzzing with holo-bikes and hover-cars.\n\nYou are Dr. Adi Kesavan, a renowned astro-archaeologist of University of Asteroid Sciences and Technologies (UAST). Legend says that an ancient alien civilization once resided in the land now known as India, leaving powerful artifacts behind.\n\nYour latest endeavor is the search for the \"Amrita Stone\", a fabled relic with alleged infinite energy. A cryptic map found in the ruins of an asteroid points its location somewhere here in New-Delhi. However, you are not the only one after it - an infamous space smugglers' guild called 'Nakshatranauts' are also on your trail.\n\nAs you begin your quest, a smoky, drone-delivered message from your old pal Rishi interrupts your thoughts.\n\n1. Listen to the message right away.\n2. Dismiss it for later; the Amrita Stone is more important.\n3. Scan the surroundings for any suspicious activity.\n4. Call the UAST for backup just in case.",
