The dilapidated building loomed ominously in front of you, its windows boarded up and the gate creaking in the wind. You had received a cryptic letter summoning you to this very spot, but with no explanation as to why.\n\nAs you hesitantly pushed open the gate, the sound of your footsteps echoed through the empty courtyard. The air was thick with anticipation, and you could feel a sense of foreboding creeping up your spine. Could this be a trap, or was there something truly sinister waiting for you inside?\n\nYou steeled yourself and made your way to the front door, which creaked open with a loud groan. The interior of the mansion was just as eerie as the exterior - cobwebs adorned the corners, dust covered every surface, and the faint scent of decay lingered in the air.\n\nAs you cautiously explored the mansion, you stumbled upon a series of locked doors, each one more forbidding than the last. It was clear that this place held many secrets, and you were determined to uncover the truth behind its dark facade.\n\nSuddenly, a blood-curdling scream pierced the silence, causing your heart to race. The sound seemed to be coming from the depths of the mansion, beckoning you to follow. Would you dare to venture further into the heart of this mystery?\n\n1. Proceed with caution towards the source of the scream.\n2. Retreat and leave the mansion immediately.\n3. Search for a weapon to protect yourself before continuing.\n4. Call out and offer help to whoever is screaming.",
