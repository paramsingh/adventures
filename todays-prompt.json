  "prompt": "India, 1857. You are Rai Singh, a valiant Rajput warrior serving in the Mughal army. Legend has it that your extraordinary strength emanates from the divine nectar that once dripped from the heavens into your ancestor's mouth. You stand tall and firm, fearless in the face of any adversity.\n\nCurrently, however, the fate of the country is entwined in the web of the British Empire's colonization. Your task is to free your land from the clutches of British tyranny.\n\nYou reside in Delhi's Red Fort. Early this morning, you received a cryptic scroll hidden in the spine of a messenger pigeon. The message is from the elusive Court of Shadows, a clandestine guild of spies, scholars, and seers who work to subtly manoeuvre the events in the country.\n\nThe scroll warns you of a potent weapon called 'The Light of Brahma', a British creation capable of unimaginable destruction. It is said to be somewhere in the richly diverse and dense jungles of Sundarbans. It's your duty to find and disable this weapon, a quest that begins in the heart of Calcutta.\n\n1. Do you embark on the journey alone, relying on your own strength and skills?\n2. Do you recruit a team of your trusted associates?\n3. Do you seek the counsel of the Court of Shadows?\n4. Do you embark on a journey to the British High Command to learn more about the weapon?",
