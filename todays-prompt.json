  "prompt": "In the mystic lands of ancient India, atop the grand peaks of the Himalayas, the sacred temple of Shambhala sits shrouded in mystery and powerful magic. It is guarded by celestial beings of fierce fang and regal feather, shaped by divine power with a sole purpose: to protect the Sanctuary of Devas.\n\nYou are an unlikely hero, a humble chaiwala (tea seller) from a small village in Rajasthan, blessed with the ancient gift of Ahimsa, a power that allows harmony with all life forms. Tonight, under the blessing of a full moon, the Devas have sent a celestial messenger, a golden furred Garuda, to seek your assistance.\n\nAs the Garuda lands beside your small tea-stall, causing a whirlwind that ruffles your attire and sends earthen teacups clattering, the creature locks its sapphire eyes onto yours and speaks in a voice like the rustling of ancient scriptures, \"The Sanctuary is under threat. Dark forces seek to usurp the Devas. Only one with the gift of Ahimsa can protect it.\"\n\n1. Listen attentively and ask the Garuda about the threat.\n2. Find it hard to believe, laugh at the Garuda.\n3. Panic and run back to your tea stall.\n4. Bow in respect and accept the mission.",
