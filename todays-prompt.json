  "prompt": "In the year 2136, India is the new frontier of space exploration. Space adventures are nothing new, but the Indian Space Agency has launched its most ambitious space mission to date - to establish a colony on a distant exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b. The Indian Space Agency has selected four crew members for this mission: Captain Vijay Singh, Engineer Diya Sharma, Medic Dr. Kunal Joshi, and Biologist Dr. Rekha Menon.\n\nThe spaceship \"SPEC-Whistler\" takes off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. However, just as the spacecraft enters deep space, it encounters a huge asteroid field. The ship's AI system successfully navigates it, but the vital communication equipment has been destroyed, leaving the crew stranded with no way of contacting Earth for help.\n\nAs the vital communication equipment is beyond repair, the team decides to make an unscheduled stop at the nearby space station Alpha-India-9. The space station is known for being a hub of space outlaws. The team knows that bargaining and open trading of black-market goods are essential if they want to fix their communication gear. They have to accomplish this task at the notorious market district on the Alpha-India-9 station while avoiding dangerous encounters with the space criminals.\n\nAs the crew arrives at the market area, they split up into groups to cover more ground. Who would you like to join?\n\n1. Captain Vijay and Diya, who focus on bargaining with the black market sellers.\n2. Drs. Kunal and Rekha, looking for information and help from other space travelers.\n3. Scout the market area solo to inspect its potential risks.\n4. Stay on the ship to try and establish an emergency communication system.",
