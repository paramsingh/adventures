Cool winds replace the stifling summer heat, lifting the fine silt swirling it into patterns against the growing night sky.

On the eastern quarter, lies the moonlit marketplace, beyond that the haunting whispers of the Wind Palace echo stories of yore. \n\nYou are Amar, the youngest son of the city\u2019s humble blacksmith, yet drawn to a destiny grander than any blade or shield your father's forge could produce.
