You, a private investigator, have come to uncover the mystery of a series of disappearances that have shaken the nearby village of Kothagiri.\n\nAs you walk, you stumble across something unusual - an old corpse, half-buried among the undergrowth. The remains are old, bony fingers clutching a tattered envelope with no indication of who it might've belonged to. Your heart races as you wonder about the unspoken secrets this envelope might contain.\n\nWhat do you want to do next?\n1. Open the envelope and read its content.\n2. Investigate the corpse for more clues.\n3. Take the envelope and continue exploring the forest.\n4. Return to Kothagiri and inform the villagers about this discovery.",
