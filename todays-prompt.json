  "prompt": "A blazing sun rises over the monumental citadel, painting a picture of warmth and majesty, against a backdrop of the majestic Himalayas. You are in the heart of ancient India, in the vast and bustling kingdom of Prayagraj. Here, humans and mystical creatures commingle, and arcane arts are as common as the spice-laden air that wafts through the crowded market streets.\n\nYou, a humble traveler armed with only a mysterious amulet and your wits, stand before the royal Palace. You're on a quest to locate the fabled Jewel of Atman, said to bestow incredible powers on its possessor. However, the jewel is protected by the four Guardians of Elements, residing in the cardinal directions of the kingdom.\n\nA decrepit sage, with a long white beard and eyes filled with centuries of wisdom, approaches. He studies your amulet, a glint of recognition flickers in his eyes. \"Ah, the Azure Medallion! Only those chosen by destiny can wield it. You bear a heavy burden,\" he mutters.\n\nA gust of wind whips up dust around the two of you momentarily blinding you. Suddenly, the old sage is gone, leaving behind a map with four distinct paths stretching out from the palace into the unknown.\n\nWhat would be your next step?\n\n1. Head north to confront the Air Guardian in the soaring mountain peaks.\n2. Take the west path towards the vast deserts to face the Earth Guardian.\n3. Set off for the southern sea to challenge the Water Guardian.\n4. Journey east into the heart of the fire mountain to meet the Fire Guardian.",
