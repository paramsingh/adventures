  "prompt": "Wrapped in the jade fog of the early dawn, you find yourself standing at the majestic entrance to the Mudumalai National Park, nestled at the foothills of the Nilgiris. The scent of exotic flora mingles with the raw tang of the wilderness, making your senses thrum with a strange excitement.\n\nBeside you stands Achyuta, a seasoned local tracker and a grizzled warrior of the indigenous tribes. \"The snake queen has cursed our lands, bringing drought and famine,\" Achyuta says, his weather-beaten face a cryptic mask of determination. \"We must retrieve the missing gem of Naga Devi that can break the curse. It lies deep within the forest, in a temple lost to time.\"\n\nAs you prepare to step into the dense undergrowth, a rustling noise catches your attention. Unfamiliar shapes move amongst the tremulous shadows of the virgin forest. \n\n1. Will you draw your weapon, ready for whatever lurks in the undergrowth?\n2. Do you call out, hoping the forest-shrouded figure is friendly?\n3. Wait silently, observing the movement and trying to identify the creature?\n4. Ask Achyuta for advice on what to do next?",
