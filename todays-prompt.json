  "prompt": "The year was 2203, and Earth had proliferated its kind across the nearby sectors of the galaxy. India had established a self-sustaining colony on Mars known as Prayagraj Colony. You are Commander Aditya, the seasoned leader of the elite Special Operations Space Regiment (SOSR). As the head of the SOSR, you've been responsible for tackling interstellar and galactic threats.\n\nJust as you settled into your midnight chai, a searing alarm sounded from your command console, jolting you out of your comfortable reverie. The message playing on the screen was a distress signal originating from the Prayagraj Colony. The colony was under attack by the Vykarsh, an eternally hostile reptilian race. The once calm and serene Mars outpost turned into a warzone.\n\nTime was of the essence, and you needed to act fast to protect the colonists and neutralize the Vykarsh threat.\n\n1. Rally your SOSR team and equip them with the latest space combat gear.\n2. Attempt to establish direct communication with the Prayagraj Colony's leader.\n3. Rendezvous with the nearest Earth space fleet in the sector to further strategize the defense.\n4. Plan a stealth reconnaissance mission to gather more information about the Vykarsh's attack.",
