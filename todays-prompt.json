  "prompt": "The year is 3050, and you are Captain Rajdeep Singh, a decorated officer in the Indian Galactic Force. Your ship, the INS Virat, orbits Earth in the sombre darkness of space. The glittering stars around you seem deceptively calm. Right in front of you, the magnificent blue and green glow of the mother planet is partially eclipsed by the imposing Moonbase Gandhi.\n\nSuddenly, a distress signal interrupts your contemplative solitude. The pulsating cry for help is from the Mars colony, a precious gem in the Indian outer space possessions. Reports of an unknown menacing entity attacking the settlement with advanced, alien technology coming up sporadically. Despite the interstellar distance, the terror in the colonists\u2019 voices cuts through you like a laser beam. The Federation has asked you to investigate the matter and rescue if necessary. \n\nFrom the command line, you find four immediate options.\n\n1. Set course immediately for Mars, armed with your standard ship weaponry.\n2. Approach the Moonbase Gandhi first to stock up on heavy-duty arms and seek scientific advice.\n3. Attempt to communicate with the unknown entity attacking the Mars colony.\n4. Send a drone to Mars for reconnaissance before deciding your next action.",
