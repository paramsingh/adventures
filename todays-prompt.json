The city is filled with neon lights, colossal skyscrapers, and flying vehicles zipping through the air. People from all walks of life, including humans, cyborgs, and other species, live and work alongside each other. You are a seasoned agent working for the Inter-Species Detective Agency (ISDA), tasked with solving crimes which involve different species.\n\nRecently, there has been a sudden surge in cyber attacks on key government infrastructure. It's suspected to be the work of a notorious group named \"The Neoteric Collective\", known for their advanced technology and disdain for the government's treatment of non-human species. As you sit down in your office at the ISDA headquarters, your personal AI assistant, EVE, informs you of an important new lead in the case.\n\n\"Agent, we have received an encrypted message, supposedly from an informant within The Neoteric Collective,\" EVE tells you in a hushed tone. \"They've agreed to meet and provide critical information, but we must choose the location carefully. It's crucial that we maintain secrecy due to the highly sensitive nature of this case.\"\n\nWhere do you choose to rendezvous with your informant?\n\n1. A hidden back alley in the bustling marketplace district of Chhatarpur.\n2. The abandoned underground subway station, long forgotten beneath the city.\n3. A quaint, low-key caf\u00e9 on the outskirts of the city, frequented by few.\n4. A virtual, secure meeting within a heavily encrypted cyber-environment.",
