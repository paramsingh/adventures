  "prompt": "The year is 2571. The world as you know, severely ravaged by centuries of climate abuse, has driven humanity to look towards the stars. India, in particular, with its rich history of astronomy, has become a hub of space exploration. The story begins in the Metropolitan City of Neo-Delhi, a bustling landscape of gleaming skyscrapers and levitating vehicles that exist beneath the enormous shadow of the Indian Space Command (ISC).\n\nYou are Captain Rohit Agarwal, an esteemed astronaut from the ISC. One evening, as you're enjoying your favourite samosa chaat in a local rooftop bistro overlooking the neon cityscape, you receive an urgent holo-message from ISC HQ. An alien artifact of unknown origin has been detected on Mars and your expertise is required.\n\nPromptly, you finish your chaat and leave for HQ.\n\n1. Do you get there by taking your sleek black hovercar?\n2. Do you prefer fast public transport - the vacuum tube?\n3. Do you opt for a traditional auto-rickshaw floating model?\n4. Or do you prefer to navigate Neo-Delhi's skyline on your personal jetpack?",
