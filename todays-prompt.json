  "prompt": "Mumbai, 2178. You are Ada, a skilled and tenacious privatised security officer patrolling the slender peninsula of the city. The bustling metropolis now partially submerged due to climate carnage. Impressive monuments of the old world partially concealed by the encroaching Indian Ocean. Dotting the skyline are gravity-defying skyscrapers, bright neon lights, and rogue drones zipping about.\n\nYou receive a distress beacon emanating from the decrepit, half-submerged remnants of Gateway of India. Despite its dilapidated state, the monument is a favoured heritage site for the city's denizens. The distress signal is encoded with an emblem of Orion Corp - a global conglomerate with a mysterious, often controversial reputation. However, your duty calls for intervention regardless of the source.\n\nIn your hands, you have SARA (Systematic Analytical Route Assistant) - an AI embedded device that frequently provides tactical and navigational assistance.\n\nAs you ready your jetpack, SARA flashes a threat assessment for your impending journey to the embattled site.\n\n1. Route 1: Fly across the crowded Upper Mumbai skyline, possibly drawing unwanted attention.\n\n2. Route 2: Take the sea route, employing your jetpack's amphibious mode to cruise through the submerged city, at the risk of aquatic cyber-predators.\n\n3. Route 3: Travel underground by weaving through a puzzle of flooded metro tunnels, potentially inhabited by roving bandits.\n\n4. Route 4: Perform a combination of the aforementioned routes, to both confuse potential pursuers and to maintain a level of unpredictability.",
