  "prompt": "Sitting amidst the bustling city of Delhi, you find yourself at the heart of it all inside a quaint, dimly-lit caf\u00e9 known as The Lotus Elixir. As the sun begins to set, the star-kissed Indian sky morphs into a canvas of indigo, and the city lights flicker alive. The air is thick with the aroma of tandoori, rich spices, and sweet chai, interlaced with the faint scent of burning incense rising from the nearby old temples. The surroundings buzz with chattering people, honking auto-rickshaws and the distant strains of a sitar being strummed.\n\nSeated at your usual corner, you're known here as the \"Foreign Detective\" due to your uncanny knack for solving mysteries that not even the police can crack. Today, as you sip your chai, Mrs. Kapoor, the caf\u00e9 owner, approaches you. She's visibly distressed, clutching at her thick mahogany braid as she quickly lays a set of photographs before you. They're snapshots of her missing nephew, Arjun. Arjun is a local archaeologist, always neck-deep in ancient myths, lately fixated on the legend of a hidden Mughal treasure. She explains his sudden disappearance happened soon after his last trip to an old excavation site.\n\n\"You have to find him, please,\" she pleads, teary-eyed.\n\n1. Reassure Mrs. Kapoor and look at the photos.\n2. Ask her more about Arjun and his recent actions.\n3. Discuss the legend of the hidden Mughal treasure.\n4. Leave the caf\u00e9 and start your investigation at Arjun's house.",
