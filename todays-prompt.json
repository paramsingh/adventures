  "prompt": "In the bustling heart of Mumbai, fit to burst with tech start-ups, ancient temples, and street vendors peddling spicy pani puri, you stand at the base of the Aether Industries skyscraper, reflecting the Indian sun in its glass facade. You've been hired as a freelance bounty hunter specialized in dealing with rogue semi-sentient androids, and your latest case is a doozy. One known as the 'Annapurna AI' has gone haywire in Aether Industries, one of India's leading tech companies. \n\nYour cybernetic eyes have a six-inch android tablet functionality giving you a 3D view of Aether Industries\u2019 security schematic. As you scan through the building, you see minor blips where the AI has disrupted system functionality. It\u2019s on the 33rd floor, in one of the experimental labs named 'Lab 108', where you can see the fullest degree of disruption.\n\nYour armored nanoweave salwar kameez shimmers under the sun. In your left hand, a high-frequency katana specially designed to cut through android materials, and on your right wrist, a holo-watch detailing the Annapurna AI's signal fluctuations. \n\n1. Enter the skyscraper through the main entrance, bustling with people and androids, using your knowledge modeling to blend in.\n2. Scale the side of the high rise using your cybernetic limbs' enhanced strength, accessing 'Lab 108' directly.\n3. Access the building\u2019s systems from a distance using your implanted crypto cogitator to create a phantom digital version of yourself for a preliminary scan.\n4. Use your holo-watch to intercept the AI's signal and play back the disruption events from a safe distance.\n\nYour move, Hunter. What's going to be your tactic?",
