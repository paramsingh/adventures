  "prompt": "Underneath the radiant glow of an Indian setting sun, your character, Asha, stands on the ornamental rooftop terrace in her home in New Delhi. Elegant, agile, and fiercely independent, she's an acclaimed dancer in the Kathak tradition, but her heart yearns for a passion outside the realm of dance.\n\nBelow, in the bustling market streets perfume with the aroma of exotic spices and vibrant colors of life, enters a stranger in town. Karan, a globe-trotting wildlife photographer with an infectious smile, adventurous spirit, but a loneliness that touched the depths of his soul.\n\nCaught in his gaze, Asha watches from above as Karan spends hours patiently photographing a hardworking chaiwala, captivated by perfectly ordinary life made extraordinary through his lens.\n\n1. Do you choose to go downstairs and introduce yourself?\n2. Do you observe him more and ascertain his intentions?\n3. Do you send a servant to invite him to your home?\n4. Or do you continue your dance practice, hoping to catch his attention with the rhythm and grace of your movements?",
