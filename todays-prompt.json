An amalgamation of the ancient sacred city and the new hyper-tech outburst, vibrant Holographic ghats meet the re-imagined Ganges, now a power source for the entire city. The old city stands juxtaposed against skyscrapers made of Plexi-Alloys, which literally scrape the monsoon infused clouds and moon-heavy skies. \n\nYou, the protagonist of our tale, are Ishaan, a prodigious Quantum Engineer working at the prestigious Indian Institute of Time Navigation (IITN). Your current project, the \"Samay Yantra\" is a device to navigate through time. Suddenly one day, the institute is infiltrated by an unknown entity. The security systems shut down momentarily and a message pops up on your HoloScreen: \"Hello Ishaan, you don't know me, but I know you. The Samay Yantra, bring it to me!\"\n\n1. Should you try to trace the HoloScreen message?\n2. Initiate shutdown and engage safety protocols for the Samay Yantra?\n3. Inform your superiors at the Institute of this security breach?\n4. Try to negotiate with the unknown entity?",
