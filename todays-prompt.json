The air is thick with pungent smells and humidity. You can hear the distant chatter of merchants and people bargaining in the nearby market.\n\nSuddenly, a scream pierces the air. The noise seems to be coming from a dilapidated building at the end of the alley. You notice the front door is cracked open, and an old sign reading \"Hotel Blue Moon\" barely hangs on by rusty hinges, swaying gently in the breeze.\n\nAs you\u2019re about to decide what to do, a mysterious figure steps out of the shadows, his face partially hidden by the hood of his dark cloak. He scans the surroundings, as if looking for something, before his attention quickly turns to you.\n\n1.) Approach the mysterious figure\n2.) Investigate the scream coming from the hotel\n3.) Slip into the shadows, staying unseen\n4.) Hurry away from the alley to the market",
