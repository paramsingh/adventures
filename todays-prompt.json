  "prompt": "The sweltering heat of the evening was exacerbated by an eerie silence that only deepened the chilling dread of the ancient temple. The ruins of this lost palace, claimed to have been abandoned by humans for centuries to ward off a haunting curse, stood tall amidst the dense jungle canopy of the Southern Ghats in India. Situated on the edge of a sharp cliff, the temple threatened to consume anyone who dared to invade its gloomy sanctuary\u2014this is where you find yourself standing.\n\nYou,-known in the legends as the fearless Aatman, had been drawn to this sullen place by an ominous prophecy foretold in your village. The prophecy, a centuries-old tale referred to as \"The Curse of the Stone Eye,\" had been the driving force behind your dangerous journey through the jungle. Legend says that a horrendous demon, Raktabija, placed a curse on the temple, causing unspeakable horrors to befall anyone who dared to step inside without permission.\n\nCricket songs emerge from the surrounding wilderness, as the stars begin to blanket the murky night sky. Tall, twisted trees extend towards the sky, their leafless branches forming a frightening silhouette against the moon's eerie glow. Shadows from the broken pillars and archways of the temple seem to elongate and morph into unsettling, spectral shapes, sending a shiver down your spine.\n\nAs you approach the ominous temple grounds...\n\n1.   Do you ignore any ominous feelings and march right into the temple?\n2.   Seek a safe campsite in the surrounding jungle to rest and prepare for entry into the temple at dawn?\n3.   Take a moment to observe the temple's exterior, searching for signs of a hidden entrance?\n4.   Try to reach out spiritually to communicate with any potential spirits that may be dwelling within the temple?",
