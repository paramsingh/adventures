  "prompt": "In the mystical heartland of ancient India, under the scorching sun and amidst the golden sands, you find yourself stirring from your slumber, dressed in garments that convey royal lineage. A tumultuous dream of the Goddess Kali calling you to an unknown quest wakes you. As you rise, your memory finds itself to be a flickering candle against the stygian curtain of amnesia. Are you a warrior or a seer, a prince or a pauper? Only your instincts and fragments of memory from within the dream guide your current understanding.  \n   \nBefore you is the intricately carved doorway leading out of your chamber. Rays of the early dawn creep in through the floral patterned jal\u012b, painting a narrative of the bustling city life of Ujjain outside. The deafening silence within the palace stirs a foreboding feeling.\n\n1. Investigate the room further for clues about your identity.\n2. Step out into the city to clear your mind and perhaps jog your memory.\n3. Meditate to discern the meaning of your dream.\n4. Call out for help hoping someone within the palace can provide answers.",
