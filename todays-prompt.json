You find yourself standing in the Bazaar of Durbaar Square, a marketplace bustling with vibrant colors, exotic aromas, and chatter of the town's folk. A young boy approaches with a trembling hand, offering you a centuries-old, dirt-covered scroll. His eyes plead for help.\n\n\"Sir,\" he stammers, \"this scroll holds a secret... a secret that can bring fortune or destruction. The Thugs of Kalighat want it for their wicked cause. The Seers of Munnar tell me that I need you.\"\n\nThe scroll is warm to the touch, decorated in intricate ancient Brahmi script. The dusty parchment seems to thrum with an energy of its own. This letter entrusts you with a quest of a lifetime - to locate the legendary treasure hidden somewhere deep within the treacherous mazes of the Thar Desert.\n\n1. Accept the scroll and begin your adventurous journey.\n2. Refuse to accept the scroll from the boy.\n3. Consider, inquiring about the Thugs of Kalighat.\n4. Take an interest in the Seers of Munnar.",
