  "prompt": "In the heart of India, at the peak of the Himalayan mountains, you find yourself standing before the renowned Temple of Vishnu. Guarded by stone elephants and intricate bronze reliefs, the temple stands a witness to many bygone eras. A gentle breeze whispers ancient tales into your ears, and the air is thick with the scent of a thousand-years worth of incense. \n\nAccording to an old-age prophecy, the temple is believed to house the divine Vajra, a weapon of Lord Indra, capable of bringing peace to the world or plunging it into an eternal nightmare, based on who wields it. It\u2019s your destiny to keep it safe from the hands of the nefarious warlord, Mahadushan, who scours region seeking its power.\n\nAs you approach the entrance, four paths lay in front of you:\n\n1. Enter through the front entrance, a grand archway decorated with countless beautifully carved sculptures.\n2. Take the secret path known only to the monks, hidden behind the waterfall cascading down from the heights.\n3. Ascend the mountain peak and use the rope-way fashioned by previous adventurers to swing into the temple.\n4. Approach through the underground labyrinth said to be filled with both lethal traps and valuable treasures.\n\nWhich path do you take?",
