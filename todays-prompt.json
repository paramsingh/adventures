  "prompt": "The sun beat down fiercely on the ancient city of Varanasi, its golden rays reflecting off the sparkling waters of the Ganges river. You find yourself standing at the entrance of a mysterious temple, its towering spires reaching up to the heavens. As you step inside, you are greeted by the cool, dim interior of the temple, the sound of hushed whispers echoing off the walls.\n\nAs you make your way deeper into the temple, you come across a group of robed figures huddled around a glowing crystal orb. They seem to be deep in discussion, their faces obscured by the shadows of their hoods. One of them turns towards you, their eyes flashing with excitement.\n\n\"Ah, traveler,\" they say in a low, melodic voice. \"You have been chosen by the ancient spirits to embark on a quest of great importance.\" \n\n1. Ask what the quest is about.\n2. Decline the offer and leave the temple.\n3. Accept the quest without knowing the details.\n4. Demand more information before agreeing to anything.",
