  "prompt": "The sun begins to set, casting long, dancing shadows across the sprawling fields of Marigold. Nestled within the heart of India, Marigold is a quaint yet mystic village, known for its vibrant colours, ancient tales and the enigmatic Yaganti temple. You are the Chosen One, the protector of Marigold, and the only one to possess the ancient Mahapataka, a sacred staff studded with rare gems capable of unimaginable magic. \n\nBut today, an eerie stillness hangs over the village. The folks of Marigold have been living in fear, for the monstrous beast, Raktabija, threatens to awaken from the crumbling Yaganti temple. As the Chosen One, it is upon you to either subdue the beast with your Mahapataka or risk losing everything.\n\nAs you approach the temple, you notice the statue of deity Nandi steadily growing in size, one of the dangerous signs of Raktabija's awakening. Explosions of power surge through your Mahapataka, bracing you for the propitious mission.\n\n1. Do you consult the Wise Sage, an oracle known for his ancient wisdom and uncanny intuitive abilities before entering the temple?\n2. Do you enter the temple directly, urging the divine power of your Mahapataka to show you the way?\n3. Do you gather your fellow villagers, teaching them defensive techniques and engaging them in the effort to subdue Raktabija?\n4. Do you head towards the Valley of Nimmakaya, rumored to contain a mystic potion that can put the dangerous beast to sleep forever?",
