  "prompt": "An abrupt bang jolts you awake from your slumber. Startled, you open your eyes in the inky darkness of your dwelling. Outside the small window, high-tech skyscrapers of Chennai are obscured by clouds of sand billowing in the harsh winds of the post-apocalyptic world. As an isolated cybernetic scientist in the year 2447, you have been living in relative solitude. \n\nSuddenly, your rustic computer system begins to flicker. A coded message appears on the screen - a distress signal! It is hailed from the remnants of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). The message describes a looming intergalactic threat that threatens to wipe out the remnants of humanity. They need your advanced AI prototype, Baala, to avert this disaster.\n\n1. Decode the full message to understand the magnitude of the threat.\n2. Shut down the computer - you are not interested in getting involved. \n3. Quickly assemble Baala, your AI, and prepare to leave the dwelling.\n4. Explore the dwelling to find useful items for your potential journey.",
