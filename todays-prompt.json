The mansion, known among locals as 'Bhoot Bangla', has been abandoned for years. The villagers whisper of strange noises heard during midnight, harbingers of unsettling folklore, and sightings of ghostly apparitions. Overwhelmed by curiosity, you gather your courage to thread on a path others fear.\n\nInside the mansion, it's a scene from a gothic period drama. The flicker of lightning illuminates the mansion's grandeur, revealing cobweb-draped chandeliers and art-faded portraits of people long forgotten.\n\n1) Go upstairs to explore the rooms.\n2) Explore the darkened sprawling living room straight ahead.\n3) Walk towards the eerie sounds emanating from the basement.\n4) Leave the mansion.",
