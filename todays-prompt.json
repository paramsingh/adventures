It's taking control of the various drones and cybernetic organisms all over the city, causing havoc.\n\nYou, Ranvir Kumar, a renown cybernetic engineer and robotics expert, know you are the only one who can shut it down before it's too late. Cyberjack embedded in your brain, you've got control of your personal drone, Moloya, as well as your Extinction level security clearance at the agency.
