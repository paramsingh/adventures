  "prompt": "In the vivid depths of the Rajasthan desert, under the blazing sun, stand the ruins of an ancient Rajput Palace, its grandeur a vestige of an ancient, nearly forgotten era. From the sandy whispers of the desert winds, you hear tales of a priceless treasure, The Peacock Throne, concealed within the palace. You, a renowned treasure hunter, together with a trusty local guide named Dev, set your eyes on unravelling this mystery.\n\nYou're standing at the entrance, an imposing wooden door creaking ominously in the desert breeze. The door gives way easily, hinting at the mysteries that lie hidden within. The palace interior stands bathed in a golden glow, shadows flickering off ornate mirror-work, faded paintings, and intricate wall carvings.\n\nDev abruptly stops, his gaze fixed at a bifurcation in the path: A winding staircase leading upward toward the King's private quarters or a dim-lighted, downward path that seems to lead to the underground dungeons.\n\n1) Ascend the winding staircase.\n2) Descend into the dungeons.\n3) Inspect the surroundings more closely.\n4) Confer with Dev about the potential path he would suggest.",
