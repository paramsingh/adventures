  "prompt": "The smell of hot metal and oil hangs thick in the air as your boots crunch on the gravel beneath your feet. Sweat drops from your brow, not due to exertion but the sweltering heat emanating from The Anvil, your starship. A sprawling being of chrome, and oddly enough, segments of intricately painted Terracotta, it gleams under the harsh sunlight in the Indian spaceport of Antariksh, nestled amidst the sand dunes of Rajasthan. You are a veteran pilot, hunting bounties floating out in the void. A transmission pings on your wrist-com.\n\nUnsettling intel awaits from an unknown source that just breached your secure quantum network.\n\n1. Open the transmission and assess the information.\n2. Ignore the transmission and conduct a routine check-up of the Anvil.\n3. Trace the transmission's origin before opening it.\n4. Report the security breach to spaceport authorities.",
