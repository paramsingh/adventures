  "prompt": "The sun is setting on the misty peak of the Himalayas, painting the sky with hues of crimson and gold. You, an intrepid explorer with a fascination for lost civilizations, stand before the legendary Gates of Mantaraya. Your rugged safari gear sticks to your skin due to the exertion of the climb and the humid air of the evening. This ancient gate is rumored to be the entrance to a long-lost city in the heart of India cloaked in myth and mystery. \n\nIn your hand, you clasp an ancient map, its paper yellowed and tattered by time. It was passed down in your family for generations and only reveals the path forward when the last rays of the setting sun cast their light over it. Sure enough, as the final ray illuminates the map, the ink sparks to life, showing you a path through the seemingly impenetrable old stone gate and the deadly labyrinth beyond.\n\nTo your right, jungle vines creep up the aged stone, a testament to the intermingling of human artistry and wild nature over centuries of abandonment. Monkeys chatter and the call of exotic birds echo around you, adding to the chorus of insects and distant roars you cannot place. Fear brushes your heart, but the thrill of adventure overpowers it. \n\nYou take a deep breath, your senses tingling with anticipation as you prepare to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.\n\n1. Open and enter through the Gates of Mantaraya.\n2. Explore your surroundings first, gather potentially useful items.\n3. Examine the map closely for any hidden symbols or messages.\n4. Climb to a higher viewpoint to observe the area from the top.",
