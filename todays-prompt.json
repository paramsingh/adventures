  "prompt": "You are Ravi, a young artist from the vibrant and chaos-filled city of Mumbai. You wake up in your small apartment, surrounded by color-drenched canvases scattered around, hinting at your passionate but unfulfilled dreams at every corner. Your heart yearns for something beyond the mundane, something that will stir emotions deep within - a love that transcends all limits. Ravi, with his paintbrushes for weapons and his heart as his canvas, is ready to paint the best masterpiece of his life- the portrait of love.  \n\nA flicker in the corner of your room catches your eye. You move closer to find a shimmering, mysteriously captivating parchment rolled neatly - absent yesterday. It seems to contain an invitation with the symbol of the royals from Jaipur. \n\nThe invitation reads -  \"Art Exhibition: Find your muse at the Royal Palace of Jaipur.\u201d\n\nCould this be the adventure of love your heart longs for? The city of Jaipur, an artist's dreamland famous for its rich culture, the vibrant colors, and home to the most beautiful lady, Meera - the Princess, rumored to be as enchanting as a moonlit night. \n\n1. Do you ignore the invitation, choosing to continue with your life as it is?\n2. Do you embark on the journey and accept the invitation, drawn by the possibility of an adventure?\n3. Do you accept the invitation purely to escape your current state and perhaps find new inspiration for your art?\n4.
