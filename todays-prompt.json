  "prompt": "The relentless summer sun beats down on the mammoth, rustic Maruthi Villa standing venerable on the outskirts of Mysuru, India. Thriving, dense trees wrap around the mansion, their whispers in the wind adding an unsettling symphony to the place's eerie solitude. The villa has a reputation that sends shivers down the villagers' spine. Legend has it that it is haunted by specters of its erstwhile residents, victims of vicious, unsolved murders. However, your keen interest in paranormal investigation and history has compelled you to set foot in that forsaken house, armed with that little bravery you can muster, and few basic tools - a flashlight, an EMF meter, and an old Indian talisman for protection. \n\nAs you step inside, the giant studded hardwood doors creak shut behind you. You are immediately submerged in icy darkness, a chilling contrast to the scorching heat outside. You flick your flashlight on, illuminating a grand entrance hall adorned with ancient paintings and sculptures. The air is dense with the taste of decay and antiquity.\n \n1. Head straight up the grand staircase to explore the upper floors.\n2. Inspect the grand entrance hall and its artifacts.\n3. Walk deeper into the mansion, towards what appears to be old, lavish living quarters.\n4. Stay and observe the intense electromagnetic fields your EMF meter is already picking up.",
