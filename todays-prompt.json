The wind blows sand from the yellow and orange dunes that stretch out around you, sending a fine mist of gold creeping along the ground.\n\nBefore you stands the city of Raghanayak, famed for its incredible collection of magical artifacts and fabled library -- home to scrolls containing lost spells and arcane knowledge.

As a young and fearless adventurer, you've journeyed from afar to seek fortune and wisdom in the city's chaotic streets.\n\nAs you approach the city's ornate gate, you witness four imposing figures: each clad in luxurious, jewel-studded clothing, their faces possessing a stern demeanor. They represent the four great dynasties that ruled Nysanthia in their time. You understand it's essential to forge an alliance with one of them to survive and thrive in this city. Whom do you choose to ally with?\n\n1. The warrior tribe, Terracor, known for their unrivaled skill in close combat and weapon mastery.\n2. The scholars of Aurak, mysterious sages wielding powerful elemental magic.\n3. Zephyrin, the wealthy merchants with vast trade networks across the continent.\n4. Araneth, the enigmatic cult with renowned healing abilities said to be gifted by the gods.",
