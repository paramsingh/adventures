  "prompt": "You awaken on the banks of the holy Ganges, beneath the towering peaks of the vast Himalayas. The scent of marigolds and incense wafts through the cool alpine air. Your robes, covered in a fine dust from your travels, rustle softly against your bony knees. You're an elderly yet sprightly Sadhu, a holy mystic, blessed with magical abilities derived from your profound meditation and spiritual practices.\n\nAs you open your eyes, you find a piece of tattered parchment clasped in your wiry hands. It's a letter from an old friend, a fellow Sadhu, who warns of a dire threat looming over the sacred land. The ancient beast of lore, N\u0101ga, a giant serpent with the power to control time has resurfaced, he writes. It seeks to plunge the world into an era of desolation and chaos.\n\n1. Scared, but determined, you decide to face the threat. You fear not the journey that lies ahead. After all, this life isn't your first, and it probably won't be the last.\n\n2. You feel a deep concern for your friend's safety. You choose to seek him out first before proceeding with any strategies.\n\n3. You decide to seek counsel from the gods themselves. The temple of the nine planets is a distance away, in the center of the nearest town.\n\n4. You realize you require stronger magical abilities to face N\u0101ga. You decide to meditate at the banks of the Ganges to enhance your strength.",
