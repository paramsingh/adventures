Suddenly, red lights flicker on and the alarms ring through the entire command center; an unidentified spacecraft approaches dangerously fast. \n\nFrom the deck, you can see the projectile hurtling towards Dhruva. Time is of the essence, Commander.\n\n1. Send a broad frequency hail asking the approaching spaceship for identification.\n2. Activate defensive shields and prepare for a potential collision.\n3.
