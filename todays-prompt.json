  "prompt": "Clouds hang heavy in the starlit sky as you arrive in the small village of Nagnath in Gujarat, India. Stepping off the train, you take a moment to inhale the incense-infused air and let the clamor of distant prayers seep into your soul. You are a world-renowned investigator, called upon by the local police to solve the mystery of the ancient temple bells which toll each night, yet no one claims to ring them.\n\nAs you progress through the village, a glimmer catches your eye; it is the mighty Sayajirao Clock Tower in the heart of the village square. Its luminescent hands read 11:57 PM - almost time for the phantom tolling. Do you...?\n\n1. Head to the clock tower in hopes to get a bird's eye view of the temple when the bells toll?\n\n2. Head directly to the temple in time for the tolling?\n\n3. Visit the local police station for a detailed briefing about the occurrence?\n\n4. Find the highest rooftop in the village to possibly catch a glimpse of the bell-ringer?",
