  "prompt": "Flickering oil lamps cast dancing shadows on the ancient stone walls of the Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya, India. The smell of incense is thick as a group of ruby-robed monks chant beneath the temple's gold-painted spire piercing the midnight sky. You, a renowned archaeologist, have been summoned by the temple's head monk after a mysterious artifact was unearthed during the temple's recent renovation.\n\nAs you approach the head monk, he hands you an old, crumbled scroll, the script on it an old form of Sanskrit; it holds the secrets to finding the legendary Dagger of Ashoka, believed to possess mysterious powers. The head monk advises you to tread carefully, for the wicked Thuggee cult seeks the weapon fiercely to unleash a catastrophic power. \n\nSuddenly, the tranquil ambiance shatters when the temple doors bang open, and shrouded figures rush in. The Thuggee cult has arrived, sooner than anyone expected.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\n1. Stand your ground and engage the cult in a fight.\n2. Grab the scroll and attempt to escape through the back entrance.\n3. Take the head monk hostage as a shield.\n4. Try to negotiate with the Thuggee cult.",
