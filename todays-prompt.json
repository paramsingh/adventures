  "prompt": "The sudden hollow hum of the alarms snapping awake in the ISRO Space Centre was drowned out by the explosion that rocked the launchpad. Racing towards the viewing window, you witness the aftermath of the wreckage. Hayagriva, India's most advanced spacecraft, scheduled to set course for the far reaches of the known universe, was now nothing more than a spewed arrangement of metal and fire.\n\nThe sharply urgent voice of Dr. Kamala Shastri, the mission coordinator cuts through the chaos. \"We have a potential catastrophic event on our hands. The spacecraft's energy core is destabilizing. It could trigger a quantum shockwave that would wipe out half the Indian subcontinent. You've got to help us prevent this!\u201d\n\nYour name is Kavita Agarwal, a quantum physicist and a member of the Hayagriva mission. Your heart pounding with adrenaline, you realize that it is up to you now.\n\n1. Race towards the control room to assess the situation.\n2. Use your handheld quantum manipulator to try and stabilize the energy core from the viewing room.\n3. Rush to the launchpad, aiming to get closer to the wreckage.\n4. Call for an emergency assembly of all the scientists to quickly brainstorm possible solutions.",
