Unknown to your loyal subjects, mixed within your royal duties is a yearning for a love that is exceptional and genuine. A prophecy made during your birth hinted that you would find your soulmate in the most unexpected place.\n\nSuddenly, your mother, the regal Queen, comes towards you with news that she arranged your marriage with Princess Mallika of the neighboring kingdom, an alliance to fortify your reign.

Refuse the arranged marriage and convey your intent to find your own love.\n3. Ask for some time to consider the situation deeply.\n4.
