The palace, once known for its royalty and grandeur, now lies in simmering shadows, whispering untold mysteries of the past. An elderly man had bequeathed you a cryptic letter, your only clue, stating, \"The truth lies where the peacock sings its dawn melody\". The message carried an uncanny hint of urgency that drew you to the palace. As an enthusiast of the unknown and cryptic, you feel an electrifying rush of adrenaline, preparing yourself for the adventure that is to unfold.\n\nArmed with a trusty flashlight and your wit, you cautiously step over the threshold, the heavy wooden doors creaking under their own weight as they admit you inside. You notice the dim torchlight dancing on the stone wall, leading you into three distinct paths. A specific detail catches your attention on each path.\n\n(1) A chilling breeze sneaks from the path on your right, carrying with it a faint, haunting melody.\n(2) A series of mysterious paintings hang along the central corridor, with a cobweb-decorated chandelier hanging precariously low from the ceiling.\n(3) Finally, the left path is ominously silent and dark, except for a single ray of moonlight illuminating a beautifully crafted peacock statue.\n\nWhich path do you dare delve into?\n\n1. The right path, drawn by the haunting melody.\n2. The central corridor with the mysterious paintings.\n3. The left path, where the peacock statue stands. \n4. Go back outside to examine the surroundings of the palace for more clues.",
