The tavern interior is bathed in a dim, eerie light filtering through the greasy, stained glass windows. Men and women cast long, monstrous shadows that sway and leer upon the musty walls. They quieten down and watch you with sharp eyes as you tread carefully over the worn-out wooden floor that creaks at your weight.\n\nJust as you start advancing further towards the bar, a brawl breaks out to your left between two burly patrons over some petty argument. Stools fly, voices roar, and all hell breaks loose.\n\n1. Stride over and break up the fight.\n2. Stand back and observe.\n3. Casualize the situation by ordering a drink.\n4.
