As a daring private investigator, you have fearlessly faced your fair share of brainteasers, but this new conundrum had you mystified.\n\nA visiting French archaeologist and esteemed historian, Prof. Henri Moreau, had received a cryptic message, pleading with him to uncover the whereabouts of an ancient artifact hidden somewhere in the city. However, only a week later, he had vanished\u2014without a clue. What you find particularly odd is that no ransom call had been made in the days that followed.\n\nYou've been hired by Prof. Moreau's closest confidant, Farah, to find the missing academic and the artifact he had been so desperate to seek. Farah is eager to accompany you to seek answers, and she has shared with you a copy of the professor's cryptic message, clearly outlining several leads to uncover the truth.\n\nYou scan the parchment's possible hints:\n\n1. Investigate the narrow alleyways of Old Delhi with Farah.\n2. Visit the bustling Chandni Chowk marketplace with Farah.\n3. Explore the mystical fort of Purana Qila with Farah.\n4. Ask around about the mysterious artifact at the National Museum with Farah.",
