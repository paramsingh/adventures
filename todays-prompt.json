Massive improvements in architecture and advanced material sciences have turned the Indian Peninsula into a tropical high-tech paradise.\n\nYou are Rakesh, a seasoned space scrapper from the beautiful city of Bangalore. Together with your crew onboard the starship SS Agnipath, you make a living by salvaging valuable resources from damaged or abandoned spacecrafts in the far reaches of space.\n\nToday's mission has taken you to the remnants of a massive battle between the Interstellar Federation - which India is an honorary member of - and an unknown enemy armada. All around you is a vast graveyard of ships, broken machines, and the cold silence of space. Time is of the essence, as other space scrappers and opportunistic factions are racing to claim their prizes.\n\nAs you're inspecting the wreckage, you receive an urgent communication on your main console:\n\n\"Rakesh, we have detected a survivor inside one of the ships. It's worth investigating but keep your guard up. We don't know who might be waiting.\" - Captain Priyanka\n\n1. Proceed to investigate the survivor alone.\n2. Send your crew member, Kaali, to check out the survivor.\n3. Make your way to the survivor with Kaali.\n4. Ignore the survivor entirely and focus on your mission.",
