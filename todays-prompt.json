As you venture deeper into the forest, you come across a group of travelers resting by a campfire. They invite you to join them and share tales of their adventures. One of them, a wise old sage, tells you of a powerful relic hidden in a nearby temple, said to grant unimaginable powers to those who possess it. Intrigued, you decide to embark on a quest to find the relic, facing danger and challenges along the way.\n\nYou look around at your fellow travelers, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames of the campfire. The sage, with his weathered face and piercing eyes, seems to carry the weight of centuries on his shoulders.

The jovial bard strums a lute, filling the air with melodies that seem to dance with the firelight. And lastly, the mysterious rogue watches you from the shadows, a glint of mischief in their eyes. Together, you form an unlikely band of adventurers, bound by a common goal.\n\nWhat do you do?\n1. Ask the sage for more information about the relic.\n2. Spar with the warrior to test your combat skills.\n3. Listen to the bard's songs and stories.\n4. Approach the rogue and ask about their past adventures.",
