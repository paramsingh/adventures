  "prompt": "You find yourself in the quiet village of Dharmapuri, located deep in the forests of India. The air is thick with heavy fog, obscuring your vision as you try to navigate the winding paths that lead to the mysterious temple rumored to hold ancient secrets. The silence is eerie, broken only by the occasional rustling of leaves in the breeze.\n\nAs you approach the temple entrance, a chill runs down your spine. The stone walls are covered in intricate carvings depicting grotesque figures and scenes of unspeakable horror. The door creaks open slowly, revealing a dark corridor lit only by flickering torches. The sound of your footsteps echoes ominously, as if the very walls are whispering secrets.\n\nYou hear a faint chanting coming from deeper within the temple, sending a shiver down your spine. Every instinct tells you to turn back, but something draws you further inside, deeper into the heart of darkness. The air grows colder, and the shadows seem to reach out to you, threatening to engulf you in their embrace.\n\nDo you:\n1. Steel yourself and continue down the corridor.\n2. Turn back and leave the temple.\n3. Investigate the source of the chanting.\n4. Search for a weapon or source of light before proceeding.",
