You spend your days toiling away in a lab filled with holograms, artificial intelligences, and cutting-edge machinery that look nothing short of outlandish.\n\nToday, though, your regular schedule going through a significant shift. As you sip your masala chai in the canteen, you are summoned to the Director's office over the loudspeaker.

Is this about project 'Garuda', ISAC's newest interstellar program?\n3. Has there been a security breach, cyber-attacks on ISAC were common these days?\n4. Or perhaps, this is about your pending vacation application, a long-awaited trip to Andaman Islands?\n\nThe Director's room lies ahead, gleaming in the fluorescent hallway. Which of the above thoughts would you like to hold onto as you knock on the door?",
