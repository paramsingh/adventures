  "prompt": "You find yourself in the depths of a dense, dark forest in the outskirts of a small village in India. The moon is hidden behind thick, swirling clouds, casting an eerie glow on the twisted trees around you. Strange whispers seem to follow you, echoing through the shadows like ghosts in the night.\n\nAs you cautiously move forward, you come across an old, abandoned temple, overgrown with vines and moss. The air grows colder as you step inside, feeling a sense of unease wash over you. The walls are adorned with faded paintings of deities, their eyes seeming to follow your every move.\n\nSuddenly, a piercing scream echoes through the temple, sending shivers down your spine. You realize you are not alone in this forsaken place. What horrors await you in the darkness?\n\n1. Investigate the source of the scream.\n2. Leave the temple and head back towards the village.\n3. Search for a weapon to defend yourself.\n4. Stay where you are and try to listen for any more sounds.",
