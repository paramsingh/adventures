  "prompt": "The year is 3033, and you awaken to a world drastically transformed. The once-turbulent metropolis of Mumbai, India has been invaded by alien flora and fauna from a distant planet named Zephyrion. The city, once filled with the buzz of traffic and crowds, is now overtaken with luminous greenery, colossal plants, and peculiar creatures. The air is laden with an eerie serenity, broken only by the alien critters' trills.\n\nYou are Dr. Ravi Sinha, a brilliant geneticist armed with a master\u2019s degree in exobiology and a constant thirst for knowledge. After years of researching and studying Zephyrion's ecology, your knowledge is now humanity's key to survival. You live in isolation in your bunker-lab, situated underneath the colossal ruins of the Gateway of India.\n\nSuddenly, an alarm system pierces through the tranquility. A message flashes on your console: \"Warning! Zephyrion Spore Storm Imminent!\" Spore storms have the capacity to morph native species into alien hybrids.\n\n1. You might run to your roof deck observatory to observe the approaching storm.\n2. You could initiate the lab's bio-shields to protect the surrounding flora and fauna.\n3. It's a moment to dwell on the radar and check the storm's magnitude.\n4. Perhaps you'd test the anti-spore serum already prepared for a situation like this.",
