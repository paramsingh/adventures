  "prompt": "The howling winds whip around the jagged remnants of an ancient palace nestled deep within the Indian forests. A flicker of your torch's flame paints dancing shadows along the cracked stone walls, half devoured by creeping ivy and time itself. As an intrepid explorer and folklore historian, you've spent weeks following the path of a legend \u2013 one about a forgotten Rajput king who is said to carry a cursed ruby. Allegedly, his restless spirit now roams the ruins of his derelict reign. \n\nYour eyes, equipped with academic curiosity and a hint of thrill-seeking, are drawn to the entrance of the palace. The arched gateway is a petrified reminder of the past, a massive piece of faded history slowly losing a battle with encroaching vegetation. The sun was beginning its timely descent, replacing the vibrant colors of the day with ominous shades of night.\n\n1. Enter the palace through the main entrance. \n2. Circle around to search for another entry point. \n3. Set up camp and wait until daylight to explore. \n4. Ignore the palace and turn back the way you came.",
