  "prompt": "You awaken in a disoriented state inside a rusting, retrofitted autorickshaw that seems to be flying through what appears to be a massive, dystopian cityscape of future Mumbai. Hovering cars are zipping by chaotically. Enormous skyscrapers, ominous in their shadowy brilliance, dwarf domes and spires of ancient palaces fusing traditional Indian architectural motifs with futuristic design elements. In a quick glance, you can see holographic billboards projecting advertisements in various languages, spiced air heavy with the aroma of street-food stalls, and the constant hum of drones enforcing traffic laws.\n\nComing back to your senses, you realise you are not alone. Across from you is a man with sinewy arms, his sharp facial tattoos highlighted against his dusky skin. In his hands, he is nervously toying with a bizarre device, his eyes conveying a sense of urgency.\n\nRecognising your awareness, he begins to speak, \"Welcome back, we almost didn't pull you out in time. You took a hit during the last mission. The Regime's agents have been on our tail, but we lost them among the dhobi ghats near Mahalaxmi. Now, we need to choose our next move fast.\"\n\n1. Ask the man for a recap of what happened.\n2. Inspect yourself for injuries.\n3. Look out of the autorickshaw to survey your surroundings better.\n4. Choose to remain silent, observing the man carefully.",
