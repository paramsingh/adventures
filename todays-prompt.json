  "prompt": "The sun sets over the bustling city of Kolar, painting the sky with hues of crimson and orange. The ancient temple bells echo through the air, and the scent of incense mingles with the aroma of desi spices from roadside stalls. Near the outskirts of the city stands a seemingly ordinary haveli, from where the journey of an extraordinarily brave person- you, is about to begin.\n\nA sense of urgency surrounds you as your childhood mentor, an elderly Pandit named Balendra, stands in front of you. His worn face is taut with fear. \n\nBalendra begins to speak, \"Ananya, I feared this day would come. The prophecy is starting to unfold; a sinister entity from the otherworld has been awakened. It seeks the Chintamani, the celestial jewel that can grant unlimited power. It resides in our haveli, hidden for centuries, but we cannot let it fall into the wrong hands.\"\n\nHe entrusts you with a brass key, wrapped in intricate carvings, that will unlock the room containing the Chintamani. \"Or so it has been foretold,\" Balendra adds, looking hopeful yet worried. \n\nJust as the words leave his lips, there erupts an earth-shaking roar, sending a shiver down Kolar. Outside, shadowy figures begin to converge on your home. The time to act is now.\n\n1. Do you rush to the room, aiming to secure the Chintamani before the intruders make their move?\n2. Do you confront the shadowy figures first, buying yourself some more time?\n3. Do you rush to Balendra, ensuring his safety before anything else?\n4. Or do you hide, hoping to evade the intruders for as long as possible?",
