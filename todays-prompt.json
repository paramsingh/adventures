As you step inside, you are greeted by the eerie glow of flickering oil lamps and the scent of incense hanging heavy in the air. The temple is adorned with intricate carvings and statues of deities, their eyes seeming to follow your every move.\n\nAs you explore further into the temple, you come across a small group of monks huddled around a table, whispering urgently to each other. They seem startled by your presence but quickly compose themselves, beckoning you over.\n\n\"We are in need of your help,\" one of the monks says, his voice trembling. \"A priceless relic has been stolen from the temple, and we fear it may fall into the wrong hands. Will you aid us in retrieving it?\"\n\n1. Agree to help the monks.\n2. Decline and continue exploring the temple on your own.\n3. Ask the monks for more details about the stolen relic.\n4. Offer to investigate the theft on your own.",
