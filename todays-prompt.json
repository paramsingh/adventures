Flickering lanterns cast dancing shadows on the walls, which are adorned with ancient symbols and murals. You are in a centuries-old temple hidden deep within the dense forests of the Western Ghats, India, surrounded by the limitless expanse of wilderness shrouded in mystery and the unknown. \n\nIn your hand, you hold a weathered parchment with strange symbols, which you suspect are clues to finding the legendary Lost City of Udaya. But be warned, peril is never far in this dense, dangerous forest teeming with creatures from Indian folklore. As an adventurer and archaeologist with an insatiable curiosity, your mission to discover this mystical city begins.\n\nBeside your makeshift cot lies a backpack with few items of immediate use: A dagger, an oil lamp, a fluffy loaf of bread, and a water canteen. There are also three exits from the room: the ornate heavy wooden door straight ahead in the northern wall, a narrow stairway that leads down into the darkness on the east, and a simple wooden door charred by time on the west.\n\n1. Inspect the parchment\n2. Take a sip of water and eat some bread\n3. Head north through the ornate door\n4. Descend the stairs to the east\n5. Move west through the simple wooden door",
