  "prompt": "The year is 2149. You're standing on the bustling streets of New Delhi, a city that's been transformed beyond recognition. Traditional clay pots have given way to digital holograms, rickshaws replaced by gleaming hovercrafts, and crumbling ruins now sit side by side with towering skyscrapers. The spicy aroma of Indian food mixes with the sterile scent of future tech, creating a sensory cocktail characteristic of this era. Not too far away, the reassuring hum of the Toroidal Power Station powered by a miniature black hole echoes through. \n\nYou, Arjun Mehta, are a renowned nanotechnology scientist, and you're quickly pulled from your reverie by a call on your InVision, a holographic communication device. It's Commander Vidushi Rawat from the Inter-Planetary Defense Task Force (IPDTF).\n\n\"Professor Mehta,\" she starts, her holograph shivering in the heat haze. \"We've lost contact with our orbital research station Indra. Last received message hinted at a mysterious entity approaching them. Your expertise in advanced nanotechnology is needed for this mission. Will you accept?\"\n\nHow would you respond?\n\n1. Accept the mission immediately. Any delay could mean life or death for the crew on Indra.\n2. Ask for more information about the situation at Indra.\n3. Ask about the mysterious entity.\n4. Request time to think about your decision. This isn't something to be agreed upon lightly.",
