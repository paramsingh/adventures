  "prompt": "An ominous wind blows through the solemn streets of Old Delhi; intrigue and danger lurk in the shadows of the ancient city. As an undercover agent with the Indian Intelligence Bureau, it's your mission to unravel the mystery gripping the city. A high-profile politician has gone missing and whispers of a cryptic cult being involved have reached your ears. With your flair for decoding mysteries and your reputation for being relentless, you are the only hope.\n\nIn the veil of the night, you find yourself standing outside a dilapidated haveli, infamous for its rumored connections with the cult. The haveli stands stark against the moonlit sky, its silhouetted parapets seeming to hide a thousand stories. There are three obvious entry points, each with their own risk. The front entrance, heavily guarded yet possibly straightforward. The backdoor, less guarded but potentially trapped. And finally, a small, narrow alleyway covered in darkness, potentially unguarded, but tight and claustrophobic.\n\n1. Brave the thick cluster of guards at the front entrance\n2. Sneak around to the less protected backdoor\n3. Navigate through the dark alleyway\n4. Scan the perimeter for more information before deciding.",
