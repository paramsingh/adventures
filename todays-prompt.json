  "prompt": "Deep within the dense jungles of Kerali, India, lies an ancient tomb rumored to be a labyrinth of horrors. Whispers passed down through generations have spoken of the Tomb of Marai, inhabited by nightmarish creatures, deadly traps, and the paranormal. However, also among these fearsome tales are whispers of powerful treasures that only the bravest, or the most desperate, would dare to hunt for.\n\nAs a thrill-seeking adventurer, you took these whispers as an irresistible challenge. After a long journey, you finally find yourself staring at the tomb's entrance. The cold, iron doors are adorned with ancient Sanskrit engravings that describe the dangers awaiting within. Determined to claim the treasures hidden inside and prove yourself as a true adventurer, you hold your trusty torch in hand, take a deep breath, and push the doors open, stepping into the darkness.\n\nAs your eyes adjust to the gloom, you hear a faint rumble from deep within the tomb, and notice three distinct pathways leading further inside, each marked with a cryptic symbol - A flaming skull, a crescent moon, and a cluster of twisted vines.\n\nWhich path do you choose?\n1. The path marked with the flaming skull.\n2. The path marked with the crescent moon.\n3. The path marked with the twisted vines.\n4. Take a moment to gather your courage before choosing a path.",
