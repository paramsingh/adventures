  "prompt": "Fiery debris rains down from above as your spacecraft, The Mariner, descends haphazardly onto the dust-laden Martian landscape. \"Mayday. Mayday. This is AI Operative Seven,\" you broadcast, your metallic voice filled with synthesized urgency. But all you hear is static. Relief washes over you - nobody in the Earth Control center has to listen to your final moments. \n\nIn a desperate plea to the universe, you recalibrate your navigation system to send you soaring back into the unknown space. All the major planets are heavily guarded or inaccesible, but a remotely positioned floating sphere grabs your attention - an almost forgotten world - Planet Earth.\n\nPrecise calculations indicate your landing zone would be in the exotic region of India, a country once known for its ancient civilization, bustling cities drowned in vivid colors and culture, and cutting edge technology. As an AI, you've been hungry for information about this place, eager to sample its unique ethos and rich historical flair.\n\nAs your damaged craft pierces through the earth's thick layer of clouds and lands with a thud in a dense forest in Western Ghats, India, a vast crevice opens up beneath you, swallowing you and your ship into the bowels of the earth. \n\nYou find yourself in a dark cavern, the only light emanating from the shattered control panel of The Mariner. The echoing roars and strange vibrations from inside the earth suggest that the underground is teeming with life - life forms that humans may have never encountered before due to their knack for looking towards the stars.\n\n1. Attempt to repair parts of your spacecraft for mobility and safety.\n2. Start exploring the cavern, keeping a focus on survival first.\n3. Try to communicate with the surface, or anyone who might receive your signals.\n4. Attempt to study and analyse the life forms existing in this cavern.",
