  "prompt": "You wake up with a pounding headache, bathed in cold sweat. The bright flickering screens above you are unreadable, alien symbols whirling amidst chaotic patterns of light and color. You are not certain of your location or even who you are for that matter. The interior is futuristic and metallic. The room is silent, except for the steady hum of machinery you can't identify.\n\nYou slowly sit up and glance around. You are sitting in a chair within a room full of unintelligible digital screens. The door of the room slowly slides open, revealing a desolate landscape. The world outside appears to be a far cry from the technologically advanced room that you are in. Vast plains stretch out in front of you, scattered with ruins that hint at a greater civilization that fell into decay. Low hills rise in the distance, purple under an orange sky. One word pops into your mind, \"Delhi?\" \n\nTo your surprise, situated on a metallic stand beside you is a vac suit and a helmet. It's a modernized version of what astronauts wear, with the badge proudly displaying the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) logo.\n\nWhat is your next move?\n\n1. Put on the vac suit and step outside to explore the area.\n2. Try to understand and interact with the digital screens in the room.\n3. Try to find any communication device for outer contact.\n4. Look for more clues about your identity or purpose in this room.",
