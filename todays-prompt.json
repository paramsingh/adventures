  "prompt": "From the neon-drenched skies of New Delhi, your spaceship accelerates, breaking Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Genetic enhancements in your Kaabil Corporation space suit increase resilience to G-forces with an odd humming sensation. Back on Earth, the daily hustle of overcrowded streets, the pulsating vibrance of Indian festivals, and the aromatic allure of street food were exchanged for the dim silence and cold absurdity of outer space.\n\nYour mission is from The Ministries' Council, formed after Earth's 77th United Nations pact: Uncover the truth of the alien signal originating from an unexplored quadrant of the Andromeda Galaxy. \n\nAboard your vessel, the 'Vayuputra', a state-of-the-art interstellar spaceship, you stand before the three main stations: navigation, engineering, and weapons control.\n\nAs the last echoes of Indian classical music fade from the ship AI, Ashoka, a choice must be made:\n\n1. Head to the Navigation station to set your course through the cosmos.\n2. Visit the Engineering station to ensure the ship is performing optimally.\n3. Go to the Weapons control to inspect the ship's defense systems.\n4. Take a moment to enjoy the view of Earth from the observation deck.",
