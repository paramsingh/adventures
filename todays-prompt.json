  "prompt": "You find yourself wandering alone through the dense and eerie forest of Dandeli, India, as darkness begins to encroach. The ancient trees whisper secrets of long-forgotten legends, sending shivers down your spine. Suddenly, you hear a strange and unsettling sound echoing through the shadows.\n\nAs you cautiously make your way towards the source of the noise, you stumble upon a small clearing where a circle of hooded figures stand, their faces hidden in darkness. They are chanting an unknown language, the air thick with an otherworldly energy.\n\nYou realize too late that you've stumbled upon a forbidden ritual, and the figures turn towards you with glowing red eyes, their intentions clear. You must make a choice:\n1. Run deeper into the forest, hoping to lose them in the darkness.\n2. Confront the figures and demand to know their purpose.\n3. Stay frozen in fear, unable to move as they close in on you.\n4. Search for a weapon nearby to defend yourself.",
