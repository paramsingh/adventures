  "prompt": "You find yourself in an abandoned village in India, surrounded by numerous decrepit houses that seem to have been abandoned for quite some time. The darkness of the night is only broken by the dim light of the moon, casting eerie shadows on the cracked stone paths.\n\nThe air is heavy with the scent of decay, and the only sound you can hear is the howling of the wind, rustling the dried branches of the dead trees. Despite the unsettling atmosphere, you can't shake off the feeling that there is something important hidden within this village, something waiting to be discovered.\n\nYou have a choice to investigate the following places:\n\n1. The rundown temple located to the East.\n2. The dilapidated mansion overlooking the village to the West.\n3. The dried-up well, lying in the center of the village.\n4. The eerie graveyard at the edge of the village to the North.",
