The moon shines dimly through the thick canopy of trees, casting eerie shadows across the forest floor. As you make your way through the forest, you can't shake the feeling that someone, or something, is watching you.\n\nThe trees seem to whisper in a language you don't understand, and the sound of snapping twigs and rustling leaves echo through the stillness of the night.

Try to find a way out of the forest\n3. Hide and wait for whatever it is to pass\n4. Call out for help",
