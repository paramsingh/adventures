  "prompt": "In a sleepy village located in the remote mountains of India, you are a paranormal investigator who's been called in to help with a series of mysterious, seemingly supernatural occurrences. The villagers have reported ghostly screams echoing from the abandoned temple atop the mountain, shadowy figures stalking the forest's edges, and a pervading, palpable sense of dread enshrouding the community.\n\nAs the sun sets and darkness falls, you finally reach the village. You are met by an elderly villager who tells you about the dark and sinister past surrounding the area - a powerful and evil sorcerer, who once resided in the temple, was thwarted by the villagers and entombed within the mountain. This ancient story, once thought to be a myth, now appears to be more real and terrifying than the villagers ever imagined.\n\nThe elderly villager hands you a package, containing items you will need on your journey: a flashlight, a book on Indian folklore, a box of golden amulets believed to ward off evil spirits, and a map of the area. With a shudder, you venture forth into the dark, suspense-laden night, choosing your next destination:\n\n1. Visit the abandoned temple on the mountain.\n2. Investigate the forest where the shadowy figures have been spotted.\n3. Delve into the mountain tomb where the evil sorcerer was sealed.\n4. Explore the village for more information and possible clues.",
