  "prompt": "A storm is brewing over the Indian Ocean as your ship sails towards the Port of Chennai. You are quite an anomaly on this rugged crew: a historian with a thirst for adventure, amidst a company of weathered sailors. Deep within your possession lies an ancient document \u2013 a map, leading to the lost city of Pataliputra, a hidden gem of the Mauryan empire, buried in the wilderness of Bihar. As waves thrash against the hull, unsettling whispers of the legendary Curse of Pataliputra circulate amongst the crew. As the scholar you are, you dismiss this as mere superstition, but even you must admit - a sense of unease looms in the air. \n\nSuddenly, a booming crack echoes through the night, light flashing across the tumultuous waves. A rogue bolt of lightning has struck the ship, tearing through the main mast, which crashed onto the deck. Panic ensues around you.\n\n1. Brave the storm and help repair the mast\n2. Try to maintain order among the panic-stricken crew.\n3. Abandon ship and swim to shore\n4. Secure your precious map and belongings before anything else.",
