  "prompt": "In the realms of ancient India, the tall, majestic towers of the mystic city of Marishkala stand sentinels to centuries of sacred lore. The Kalyani river, shimmering under the vast, indigo skies, wraps the city in a glowing, azure embrace. Here, in this cradle of fables and magic, lives Devak, the son of a humble potter renowned for his diligent spirit and boundless curiosity.\n\nOne dusky evening, Devak stumbles upon a weathered parchment wrapped in ivory silk. On unraveling the silk, the parchment reveals cryptic symbols etched against time-worn gold ink. The prophecy speaks of the reincarnation of the great, long-forgotten warrior king, Garuda Varman. A hero destined to vanquish the menacing demon king, Raktasura, who threatens to plunge Marishkala into eternal darkness.\n\nDevak strongly feels a strange connection with the prophecy. However, he's unsure about his destined path to restore order in Marishkala. He turns around, looking for some guidance:\n\n1. Devak seeks the counsel of his wise old father for interpreting the prophecy.\n2. Devak heads to the city's sacred temple to pray for divine guidance.\n3. Devak meets his bosom friend, an apprentice of the court magician, for a more mystical interpretation of the prophecy.\n4. Devak decides to ignore the parchment; he is too young and too ordinary to shoulder such a massive responsibility.",
