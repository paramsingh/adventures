  "prompt": "You find yourself standing in a bustling market in the heart of Mumbai, India. The aroma of spices and incense fills the air as vendors hawk their wares under colorful canopies. Among the crowd, you spot a mysterious figure dressed in traditional Indian attire, their face obscured by a scarf. They beckon you to follow them down a narrow alleyway, disappearing into the maze of streets before you can catch up.\n\nAs you make your way through the labyrinthine alleys, you come across a hidden courtyard surrounded by crumbling buildings. The figure is waiting for you, standing before a large wooden door that seems to lead into an ancient temple. Without a word, they motion for you to enter.\n\nFeeling a sense of trepidation, you push open the door and step into the dimly lit temple. The air is heavy with the scent of age-old incense and the sound of chanting fills the space. At the far end of the temple, you see a group of people gathered around a flickering candle, their faces hidden in shadow.\n\nIn the center of the room, a pedestal holds a gleaming artifact - a jewel-encrusted dagger that seems to glow with an inner light. The figure who led you here gestures towards the dagger, their eyes gleaming with a mixture of fear and anticipation.\n\n1. Approach the group and ask about the dagger.\n2. Reach out and take the dagger for yourself.\n3. Turn and flee from the temple.\n4. Stay and observe the mysterious ritual.",
