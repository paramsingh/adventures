  "prompt": "You find yourself standing at the entrance of an ancient temple hidden deep within the lush jungles of Southern India. The air is thick with humidity, and the sounds of exotic birds echo through the heavy canopy above. As you take your first step into the temple, an eerie chill runs down your spine.\n\nThe temple is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting eerie shadows on the ancient carvings adorning the walls. Symbols you don't recognize are etched into the stone, whispering secrets of a long-forgotten civilization.\n\nSuddenly, a figure steps out from the shadows. It is a mysterious woman dressed in traditional Indian clothing, her eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light. She introduces herself as Priya, a local historian who has been studying the temple for years.\n\n\"I need your help,\" she says, her voice urgent. \"There have been strange occurrences here, and I believe there is a malevolent force at work. Will you assist me in uncovering the secrets of this temple?\"\n\n1. Ask Priya to explain the strange occurrences.\n2. Offer to help Priya without asking for more details.\n3. Decline Priya's offer and leave the temple.\n4. Insist on knowing more before agreeing to help.",
