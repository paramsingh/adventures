  "prompt": "Majestic forts towering towards the sky, the relentless sun beating down, and the vibrant hues of the bustling bazaars - welcome to the land of Rajasthan, India. You, the explorer, seek a fabled treasure hidden amidst the sands, a treasure said to grant unimaginable powers.\n\nAs the warm winds of the Thar desert whip around you, you\u2019re at the edge of the epic Jaisalmer Fort, built in the heart of the Golden City. Legends reverberate through its stone walls, tales of mighty Maharajas and their invaluable stashes. But everyone warns you, saying the fort is cursed. Ancient spirits rest uneasily and do not take kindly to trespassers. \n\nIn your hands, you hold a worn-out, tattered map you bargained for in the bazaars. According to the map, the treasure rests somewhere within this gargantuan fort. However, you must decide: \n\n1. Embark on your search in the daylight, banking on the bustling crowds as a cover but also risking who might see and follow you.\n2. Venture under the cloak of the night, when spirits are said to roam the fort, but maybe they'll guide those worthy of the treasure.\n3. Sneak in right at the change of the guards, a risky move that might involve a tussle or two.\n4. Opt for a different entrance, using the map's hidden paths, hoping that it's not a trap set by the mapmaker himself.",
