  "prompt": "A high-pitched sound of distressed electronics jerks you from sleep. Your cabin inside the Avalon IX, a space station in orbit around Earth, is bathed in red warning light. The screens alight with error messages in languages you don't understand.\n\nA distress signal sounds from the control deck. Your heartbeat rises, matching the rhythm as the ship rumbles ominously. Looking out the small porthole window, you see streaks of sparks flying off the station's outer hull, glittering against the backdrop of Earth. The emerald green and sapphire blue continent is India, gleaming beneath the velvet darkness.\n\nYou are Dr. Aditi Kapoor, an astronaut physicist with a unique combination of indigenous survival skills honed growing up in the foothills of the Himalayas and a brilliant mind shaped at the Indian Space Research Organisation.\n\nYour task: to discover the source of the danger, maintain Avalon IX\u2019s functioning, and report back to Earth. \n\nFrom the alarm\u2019s pattern, you infer it could be one of these four possibilities: \n\n1. Hull breach in the storage bay\n2. A critical failure in the AI systems\n3. Power core instability\n4. Alien intrusion (Although this has never happened before)\n\nWhich problem would you like to investigate first? \n1. Hull breach in the storage bay \n2. Critical failure in the AI system \n3. Power core instability \n4. Alien intrusion",
