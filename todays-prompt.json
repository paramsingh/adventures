  "prompt": "On the mystical banks of the holy Ganges river, in the heart of the ancient city of Varanasi, you stand, staring at the burning ghats with their flickering fires reflecting on the water. Your heart pulsates with purpose as you contemplate your compelling quest: to find your one true love, Krishna, who mysteriously vanished years ago.\n\nBefore you, bustling streets filled with vibrant colors, ebullient markets, echoes of temple bells and chants of saffron-clad monks, and the tantalizing aroma of countless exotic spices and freshly cooked street food create a bewitching ambiance.\n\n1. You can venture into the labyrinthine alleys searching for the soothsayer who just might hold a clue to Krishna's whereabouts.\n2. You can decide to proceed to the riverside where Krishna and you once secretly shared tender moments under the moonlit sky.\n3. You may prefer to seek the blessings at the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple, hoping it would guide your path.\n4. Alternatively, you could interact with the boatman by the ghats, as he might have a tale or two about the lost souls he's seen.",
