  "prompt": "In the small and mysterious village of Paranipur, India, a moonless night blankets the shadows even deeper through the eerily narrow alleyways. Your heart races as you roam the ancient, narrow and twisted streets, full of bizarre and unusual legends. The village is notorious for the dark folklore that surrounds it: frightening apparitions, terrifying whispers, and the sudden disappearances of its residents. You received a letter urging you to come to this village, which contained a dire message from a loved one - your prolonged absence has put you squarely in the midst of this cursed region.\n\nWhile your lantern struggles to keep the darkness at bay, a sense of dread creeps up your spine, accompanied by whispers from an unseen presence. The shadows become thicker and more menacing as you come across a crossroads leading to four different paths. Each path promises a different fate and an even darker, more unsettling secret.\n\n1. Head towards the eerie mansion on the left, enveloped in a sinister fog.\n2. Continue down the right path, which leads to an ancient, underground crypt.\n3. Walk into the dense, haunted forest ahead of you, filled with twisted trees and strange sounds.\n4. Take the path leading to a seemingly abandoned temple with its old, crumbling walls.",
