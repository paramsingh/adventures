  "prompt": "You awaken abruptly in a tattered room of an abandoned haveli in Varanasi, India. Musty air clings to your clothes like a second skin. Curiously, in your pocket, you discover a piece of a letter with three uncanny cryptic clues: a burning Banyan tree, a leering mask, and an indecipherable coin. \n\nSuddenly, you perceive a cold, eerie whisper in your ears, \"Three chambers hide their truths. Seek them and survive...or stay and meet your doom.\" \n\nYou spot three doors around you. The unnerving whisper seems to emanate from each - a chill running down your spine tells you they're not ordinary doors. \n\n1. Approach the door with intricate Banyan tree carvings. \n2. Investigate the door with the grotesque mask hanging off of it.\n3. Dash towards the door with golden coin symbols etched into the wood.\n4. Stay put and inspect your surroundings further.",
