  "prompt": "In the magical land of Drishtanta, northeast of the great city of Hastinapur in ancient India, lived four extraordinary beings, each with special abilities representing the four cardinal directions: North, South, East, and West. They were guardians of an enchanted gem known as Ojasvi, which maintained balance and kept evil at bay. This mystical gem emitted energy vital for the survival of their world.\n\nRecently, the gem Ojasvi began to fade, its power diminishing day by day. A vast darkness began to spread across Drishtanta, and strange, terrifying creatures called Kalnemi emerged from the shadows. To retrieve the light and restore balance to their realm, the four guardian spirits gathered and sent a call for a valiant adventure-seeker, capable of braving the relentless Kalnemi and embarking on the quest to reinvigorate the gem.\n\nThat adventure-seeker is you.\n\nYou find yourself standing at the foot of a magnificent tower, crumbling under the weight of the ages, where the four guardian spirits await your arrival, hovering in the air like celestial entities.\n\n1. Approach the guardian spirits.\n2. Examine the tower closely.\n3. Inspect your surroundings for any signs of danger.\n4. Call out to the guardian spirits."
